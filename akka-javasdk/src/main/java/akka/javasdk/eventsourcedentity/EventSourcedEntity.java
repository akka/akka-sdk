/**
 * Event Sourced Entities are stateful components that persist changes as events in a journal rather
 * than storing the current state directly. The current entity state is derived by replaying all
 * persisted events. This approach provides a complete audit trail and enables reliable state
 * replication.
 *
 * <p>Event Sourced Entities provide strong consistency guarantees through entity sharding, where
 * each entity instance is identified by a unique id and distributed across the service cluster.
 * Only one instance of each entity exists in the cluster at any time, ensuring sequential message
 * processing without concurrency concerns.
 *
 * <p>The entity state is kept in memory while active and can serve read requests or command
 * validation without additional reads from the journal. Inactive entities are passivated and
 * recover their state by replaying events from the journal when accessed again.
 *
 * <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Model the entity's state and its domain events
 *   <li>Implement behavior in command and event handlers
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Event Sourcing Model</h2>
 *
 * <p>Unlike traditional CRUD systems, Event Sourced Entities never update state directly. Instead:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Commands validate business rules and persist events representing state changes
 *   <li>Events are applied to update the entity state through the {@link #applyEvent(E)} method
 *   <li>The current state is always derived from the complete sequence of events (and snapshot, if
 *       exists)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Command Handlers</h2>
 *
 * Command handlers are methods that return an {@link Effect} and define how the entity responds to
 * commands. The Effect API allows you to:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Persist events and send a reply to the caller
 *   <li>Reply directly without persisting events
 *   <li>Return an error message
 *   <li>Delete the entity
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Event Handlers</h2>
 *
 * <p>Events must inherit from a common sealed interface, and the {@link #applyEvent(E)} method
 * should be implemented using a switch statement for compile-time completeness checking.
 *
 * <h2>Snapshots</h2>
 *
 * <p>Akka automatically creates snapshots as an optimization to avoid replaying all events during
 * entity recovery. Snapshots are created after a configurable number of events and are handled
 * transparently without requiring specific code.
 *
 * <h2>Example Implementation</h2>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Component(id = "shopping-cart")
 * public class ShoppingCartEntity extends EventSourcedEntity<ShoppingCart, ShoppingCartEvent> {
 *   private final String entityId;
 *
 *   public ShoppingCartEntity(EventSourcedEntityContext context) {
 *     this.entityId = context.entityId();
 *   }
 *
 *   @Override
 *   public ShoppingCart emptyState() {
 *     return new ShoppingCart(entityId, Collections.emptyList(), false);
 *   }
 *
 *   public Effect<Done> addItem(LineItem item) {
 *     var event = new ShoppingCartEvent.ItemAdded(item);
 *
 *     return effects()
 *         .persist(event)
 *         .thenReply(newState -> Done.getInstance());
 *   }
 *
 *   public ReadOnlyEffect<ShoppingCart> getCart() {
 *     return effects().reply(currentState());
 *   }
 *   @Override
 *   public ShoppingCart applyEvent(ShoppingCartEvent event) {
 *     return switch (event) {
 *       case ShoppingCartEvent.ItemAdded evt -> currentState().addItem(evt.item());
 *       // handle all events ...
 *     };
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Concrete classes can accept the following types in the constructor:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link EventSourcedEntityContext} - provides entity context information
 *   <li>Custom types provided by a {@link akka.javasdk.DependencyProvider} from the service setup
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Concrete classes must be annotated with {@link akka.javasdk.annotations.Component} with a
 * stable, unique identifier that cannot be changed after production deployment.
 *
 * <h2>Multi-region Replication</h2>
 *
 * Event Sourced Entities support multi-region replication for resilience and performance. Write
 * requests are handled by the primary region, while read requests can be served from any region.
 * Use {@link ReadOnlyEffect} for read-only operations that can be served from replicas.
 *
 * <h2>Immutable state record</h2>
 *
 * <p>It is recommended to use immutable state objects, such as Java records, for the entity state.
 * Immutable state ensures thread safety and prevents accidental modifications that could lead to
 * inconsistent state or concurrency issues.
 *
 * <p>While mutable state classes are supported, they require careful handling:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Mutable state should not be shared outside the entity
 *   <li>Mutable state should not be passed to other threads, such as in {@code CompletionStage}
 *       operations
 *   <li>Any modifications to mutable state must be done within the entity's event handler
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Collections in State:</strong> Collections (such as {@code List}, {@code Set}, {@code
 * Map}) are typically mutable even when contained within immutable objects. When updating state
 * that contains collections, you should create copies of the collections rather than modifying them
 * in place. This ensures that the previous state remains unchanged and prevents unintended side
 * effects.
 *
 * <p><strong>Performance Considerations:</strong> Defensive copying of collections can introduce
 * performance overhead, especially for large collections or frequent updates. In
 * performance-critical scenarios, this recommendation can be carefully tuned by using mutable state
 * with strict adherence to the safety guidelines mentioned above.
 *
 * <p>Using immutable records with defensive copying of collections eliminates concurrency concerns
 * and is the preferred approach for state modeling in most cases.
