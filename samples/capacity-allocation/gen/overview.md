# Capacity Allocation System: Overview

## Purpose

The Capacity Allocation System demonstrates how to build a scalable, resilient architecture for managing fixed capacity resources across millions of users and allocation units. This pattern is essential for high-scale environments where traditional approaches would face bottlenecks due to concurrency, consistency challenges, and performance limitations.

## Key Features

- **Sharded capacity management** that scales horizontally across nodes
- **Event-driven allocation workflow** with built-in recovery mechanisms
- **Rule-based allocation validation** with user-specific constraints
- **Cross-user and cross-pool activity tracking**
- **Client-side load balancing** with intelligent fallback strategies

## Real-World Applications

### Digital Content Distribution

**Use Case:** Streaming platforms managing concurrent viewer limits for major launches or live events

**Scale Factors:**

- Millions of concurrent streaming slots
- Hundreds of millions of global subscribers
- Millions of session initiations per hour

When a major streaming platform releases a highly anticipated series, millions of viewers attempt to stream within minutes. The sharded capacity architecture distributes viewer sessions across regions while respecting licensing limits and quality tier allocations.

### Mobile Network Resource Management

**Use Case:** Telecom providers allocating bandwidth across cell towers and service tiers

**Scale Factors:**

- Billions of bandwidth/connection slots
- Hundreds of millions of mobile subscribers
- Tens of millions of connection requests per minute

During high-traffic events like sports championships, the system must handle millions of bandwidth allocation requests per minute while maintaining service level guarantees for premium subscribers across thousands of cell towers and frequency bands.

### Limited-Edition Product Releases

**Use Case:** E-commerce platforms managing high-demand flash sales

**Scale Factors:**

- Limited product inventory (thousands to millions of units)
- Tens of millions of potential buyers
- Millions of purchase attempts within minutes

When limited-edition items drop (like exclusive sneakers or electronics), the capacity system shards inventory across fulfillment centers while creating a consistent view of availability, processing millions of reservation requests within seconds while preventing cart collisions.

### Online Gaming Matchmaking

**Use Case:** Game platforms managing server allocation for players

**Scale Factors:**

- Millions of concurrent player slots
- Hundreds of millions of registered players
- Millions of matchmaking requests per hour

Popular battle royale games with hundreds of millions of registered users regularly handle 10+ million concurrent players, using the sharded capacity system to manage player distribution across game instances while maintaining skill balance and latency requirements.

### Global Ticket Sales

**Use Case:** Ticketing platforms selling high-demand event tickets

**Scale Factors:**

- Hundreds of thousands to millions of tickets
- Tens of millions of potential purchasers
- Millions of ticket requests within minutes

When tickets for major concerts go on sale simultaneously, the system faces 20+ million concurrent purchase attempts. The capacity allocation architecture shards inventory across venues and seating sections, processing millions of seat selections per minute while maintaining seat adjacency rules.

## Benefits of Sharded Architecture

1. **Horizontal Scaling** - Capacity management scales across thousands of nodes
2. **Localized Contention** - Prevents "thundering herd" problems during high-demand events
3. **Failure Isolation** - Issues affecting one shard don't cascade to the entire system
4. **Optimized Routing** - Directs users to shards with available capacity
5. **Flexible Deployment** - Shards can be distributed across multiple data centers or cloud regions

This sample demonstrates how to implement these patterns using Akka's powerful toolkit for building distributed, resilient, and scalable applications.
