# Build a Customer Registry with Query Capabilities

This guide will walk you through the process of creating, retrieving, and updating information from a customer registry service.

## Prerequisites

- An [Akka account](https://console.akka.io/register)
- Java 21 (we recommend [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/marketplace/))
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [`curl` command-line tool](https://curl.se/download.html)

## Concepts

### Designing

To understand the Akka concepts behind this example, see [Development Process](https://doc.akka.io/concepts/development-process.html) in the documentation.

### Developing

This project demonstrates the use of Event Sourced Entity and View components. For more information, see [Developing Services](https://doc.akka.io/java/index.html).

## Build

Use Maven to build your project:

```shell
mvn compile
```

## Run Locally

To start your service locally, run:

```shell
mvn compile exec:java
```

## Steps

### 1. Create a new customer

To add a new customer to the registry, use the following command:

```shell
curl -i localhost:9000/customer/one \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -XPOST \
  --data '{"email":"test@example.com","name":"Testsson","address":{"street":"Teststreet 25", "city":"Testcity"}}'
```

### 2. Retrieve customer information

To retrieve details of a specific customer:

```shell
curl localhost:9000/customer/one
```

### 3. Query customers by email

To find a customer using their email address:

```shell
curl localhost:9000/customer/by-email/test%40example.com
```

### 4. Query customers by name

To search for a customer by their name:

```shell
curl localhost:9000/customer/by-name/Testsson
```

### 5. Update customer name

To change a customer's name:

```shell
curl -i -XPATCH --header "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9000/customer/one/name/joe
```

### 6. Update customer address

To modify a customer's address:

```shell
curl -i localhost:9000/customer/one/address \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -XPATCH \
  --data '{"street":"Newstreet 25","city":"Newcity"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure that:

- The Customer Registry service is running and accessible on port 9000.
- Your `curl` commands are formatted correctly.
- The customer ID (e.g., "one") matches an existing customer in the registry.

## Need help?

For questions or assistance, please refer to our [online support resources](https://doc.akka.io/support/index.html).

## Deploy

To deploy your service, install the `akka` CLI as documented in [Install Akka CLI](https://doc.akka.io/akka-cli/index.html), and configure a Docker Registry to upload your Docker image.

Update the `dockerImage` property in the `pom.xml`, and refer to [Configuring Registries](https://doc.akka.io/operations/container-registries.html) for instructions on making your Docker image available to Akka.

Finally, use the [Akka Console](https://console.akka.io) to create a project. Deploy your service by packaging and publishing the Docker image through `mvn deploy`, then deploy the image via the `akka` CLI.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've successfully built and interacted with a customer registry service using Akka. This project demonstrates the power of Event Sourced Entity and View components in responsive applications. Youâ€™ve learned how to create, retrieve, update, and query customer information.

## Next steps

Now that you've built a basic customer registry, take your Akka skills to the next level:

1. **Expand the service**: Add features such as deleting customers or more complex query capabilities.
2. **Explore other Akka components**: Dive deeper into Akka's ecosystem to enhance your application.
3. **Join the community**: Visit the [Support page](https://doc.akka.io/support/index.html) to find resources where you can connect with other Akka developers and expand your knowledge.
