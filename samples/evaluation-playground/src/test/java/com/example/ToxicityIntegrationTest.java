Some of us figured this out on our own without needing our hands held. It's frustrating to see the forums flooded with the same simple questions from people who clearly haven't put in the slightest effort to learn.

        Welcome to the community! I've noticed a lot of questions about memory management recently. It can be a tricky topic when you're just starting out. There's a great 10-minute tutorial that covers the fundamentals really well, and I'd recommend checking that out first as it might answer your question. For more specific issues, providing a code snippet really helps us understand what's going on. Let's work through it together.
