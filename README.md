Akka
====
*Akka is a powerful platform that simplifies building and operating highly responsive, resilient, and scalable services.*


The platform consists of
* the [**Akka SDK**](https://doc.akka.io/) for straightforward, rapid development with AI assist and automatic clustering. Services built with the Akka SDK are automatically clustered and can be deployed on any infrastructure.
* and [**Akka Automated Operations**](https://doc.akka.io/operations/akka-platform.html), a managed solution that handles everything for Akka SDK services from auto-elasticity to multi-region high availability running safely within your VPC.

The **Akka SDK** and **Akka Automated Operations** are built upon the foundational [**Akka libraries**](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-dependencies/current/), providing the building blocks for distributed systems.
