== SDK 3.3.0

This release introduces support for Java 21 virtual threads across all user component and endpoint logic. As a result, it is now safe to perform blocking I/O operations without occupying underlying OS threads.

You no longer need to use `CompletionStage` or `CompletableFuture` composition when making calls using component clients, HTTP clients, or gRPC clients. Where services previously used `.invokeAsync()` and handled a future, you can now simply use `.invoke()` and work directly with the returned result.

=== Breaking Changes

To simplify usage and improve developer experience, this release includes a few breaking changes. If your service
relies on any of the following features, you will need to update your implementation:

* gRPC endpoints for unary and client streaming methods now return the response message directly, instead of wrapping it in a `CompletionStage`.
* gRPC clients now return the response value directly for unary and client streaming calls. For asynchronous behavior, the request builder APIs (`grpcClient.someMethod().invokeAsync(parameter)`) are still available.

=== Deprecations

Timer scheduling and cancellation via `TimerScheduler.startSingleTimer(...)` and `TimerScheduler.cancel()` are now
deprecated. Instead, use `TimerScheduler.createSingleTimer(...)` and `TimerScheduler.delete()`. Note that these two
new methods are blocking operations that return `void`.

If you still prefer non-blocking operations, new asynchronous alternatives have been introduced: `createSingleTimerAsync()` and `deleteAsync()`.

=== Blocking and Parallelism

To support parallel execution of blocking logic within completion stages, the Service Setup, Endpoints, Consumers, Timed Actions, and Workflows can now accept a `java.util.concurrent.Executor` via their constructors.

The Akka SDK provides a virtual-thread-enabled executor that is safe for running blocking operations. When using the standard Java `CompletableFuture` or `CompletionStage` APIs, you can supply this executor as an additional parameter to methods accepting lambdas, enabling safe parallelism for blocking tasks.
