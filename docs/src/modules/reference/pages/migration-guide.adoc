== SDK 3.5.5

Akka SDK 3.5.5 deprecates the `@AgentDescription` annotation in favor of using `@Component` for agent metadata (name and description) and the new `@AgentRole` annotation for specifying agent roles. This change aligns agent configuration with other component types and provides a more consistent API.

=== Migrating from @AgentDescription to @Component and @AgentRole

The `@AgentDescription` annotation is now deprecated. To migrate your agent classes:

**For agent name and description**:

- Remove the `@AgentDescription` annotation
- If using `@AgentDescription.role` field, add an `@AgentRole` annotation instead.
- Add or update the `@Component` annotation with `name` and `description` fields:

.Before:
[source,java]
----
@Component(id = "my-agent")
@AgentDescription(
    name = "My Agent",
    description = "An agent that does something useful",
    role = "worker")
public class MyAgent extends Agent {
    // ...
}
----

.After:
[source,java]
----
@Component(
    id = "my-agent",
    name = "My Agent",
    description = "An agent that does something useful")
@AgentRole("worker")
public class MyAgent extends Agent {
    // ...
}
----

**Update imports**:

- Add `import akka.javasdk.annotations.AgentRole;` if you're using agent roles
- Keep `import akka.javasdk.annotations.Component;`

**Backward compatibility**:

- The framework will continue to support `@AgentDescription` for backward compatibility
- However, you cannot use both the old and new annotations for the same fields (e.g., both `@AgentDescription.name` and `@Component.name` will cause a validation error)
- New features and improvements will only be available with the new annotation style

== SDK 3.5.4

Akka SDK 3.5.4 introduces a new `@Component` annotation, replacing the legacy `@ComponentId` for identifying components. This change streamlines component configuration and enables new features and improvements. The migration is straightforward and ensures backward compatibility for existing codebases.

## Migrating from @ComponentId to @Component

The `@ComponentId` annotation is now deprecated in favor of the new `@Component` annotation. To migrate your codebase:

**Replace usages of `@ComponentId`**:

- Remove the `@ComponentId("your-id")` annotation from your component classes.
- Add the `@Component` annotation, specifying the required `id` and optionally `name` and `description` fields:
```java
@Component(id = "your-id",
           name = "Your Name",
           description = "Description")
public class YourComponent { ... }
```

**Update imports**:

- Change `import akka.javasdk.annotations.ComponentId;` to `import akka.javasdk.annotations.Component;`

**Test backward compatibility**:

- The framework will continue to support `@ComponentId` for backward compatibility, but new features and improvements will only be available with `@Component`.


== SDK 3.3.0

This release introduces support for Java 21 virtual threads across all user component and endpoint logic. As a result, it is now safe to perform blocking I/O operations without occupying underlying OS threads.

You no longer need to use `CompletionStage` or `CompletableFuture` composition when making calls using component clients, HTTP clients, or gRPC clients. Where services previously used `.invokeAsync()` and handled a future, you can now simply use `.invoke()` and work directly with the returned result.

=== Breaking Changes

To simplify usage and improve developer experience, this release includes a few breaking changes. If your service
relies on any of the following features, you will need to update your implementation:

* gRPC endpoints for unary and client streaming methods now return the response message directly, instead of wrapping it in a `CompletionStage`.
* gRPC clients now return the response value directly for unary and client streaming calls. For asynchronous behavior, the request builder APIs (`grpcClient.someMethod().invokeAsync(parameter)`) are still available.

=== Deprecations

Timer scheduling and cancellation via `TimerScheduler.startSingleTimer(...)` and `TimerScheduler.cancel()` are now
deprecated. Instead, use `TimerScheduler.createSingleTimer(...)` and `TimerScheduler.delete()`. Note that these two
new methods are blocking operations that return `void`.

If you still prefer non-blocking operations, new asynchronous alternatives have been introduced: `createSingleTimerAsync()` and `deleteAsync()`.

=== Blocking and Parallelism

To support parallel execution of blocking logic within completion stages, the Service Setup, Endpoints, Consumers, Timed Actions, and Workflows can now accept a `java.util.concurrent.Executor` via their constructors.

The Akka SDK provides a virtual-thread-enabled executor that is safe for running blocking operations. When using the standard Java `CompletableFuture` or `CompletionStage` APIs, you can supply this executor as an additional parameter to methods accepting lambdas, enabling safe parallelism for blocking tasks.
