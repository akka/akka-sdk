= JOIN

The `JOIN` clause combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This allows you to query and retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
[<join_type>] JOIN <table_name> ON <join_condition>
----

== Elements

`join_type`::
Optional specification of the type of join to perform. Available options include `INNER` (default), `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `FULL`. May also include the optional keyword `OUTER`.

`table_name`::
The name of the table to join with the main table specified in the `FROM` clause.

`join_condition`::
A condition that specifies how the tables should be joined, typically by matching column values across tables.

== Join Types

The View query language supports several join types:

`INNER JOIN` (or just `JOIN`)::
Returns rows when there is a match in both tables. Rows with no match in the other table are excluded.

`LEFT [OUTER] JOIN`::
Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. When there is no match, NULL values appear for columns from the right table.

`RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN`::
Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. When there is no match, NULL values appear for columns from the left table.

`FULL [OUTER] JOIN`::
Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Combines the effect of LEFT and RIGHT joins.

== Examples

.Basic INNER JOIN
[source,sql]
----
SELECT customers.name, orders.id
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON orders.customerId = customers.id
----

.LEFT JOIN (keeping all customers)
[source,sql]
----
SELECT customers.name, orders.id
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.customerId = customers.id
----

.RIGHT JOIN (keeping all orders)
[source,sql]
----
SELECT customers.name, orders.id
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders ON orders.customerId = customers.id
----

.FULL JOIN (keeping all records)
[source,sql]
----
SELECT customers.name, orders.id
FROM customers
FULL JOIN orders ON orders.customerId = customers.id
----

.Multiple JOINs
[source,sql]
----
SELECT customers.name, orders.id, products.name AS product_name
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON orders.customerId = customers.id
JOIN products ON orders.productId = products.id
----

.JOIN with complex condition
[source,sql]
----
SELECT customers.name, orders.id
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON orders.customerId = customers.id AND orders.active = true
----

== Notes

* The `INNER` keyword is optional in `INNER JOIN` - simply using `JOIN` implies an inner join
* The `OUTER` keyword is optional in `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`
* JOIN conditions can use AND/OR operators for more complex joining logic
* Multiple JOINs can be chained to combine data from more than two tables
* When column names are ambiguous (exist in multiple tables), they must be qualified with the table name
