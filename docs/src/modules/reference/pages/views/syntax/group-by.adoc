= GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. This is typically used with the `collect()` function to create collections of values from grouped data.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
GROUP BY <column> [, <column>...]
----

== Elements

`column`::
A column name or expression by which to group the results. Multiple columns can be specified, separated by commas.

== Features

Grouping::
Groups rows with the same values in the specified columns into a single row in the result.

Collection Creation::
When combined with the `collect()` function, creates arrays or collections of values from the grouped rows. A collection will also be implicitly derived when a wildcard `\*` is aliased to a list field in the result object (for example, `* AS someList`).

== Examples

.Group by a single column and collect products
[source,sql]
----
SELECT category, collect(*) AS products
FROM products
GROUP BY category
----

.Group by a single column and collect specific fields
[source,sql]
----
SELECT category, collect(name) AS productNames
FROM products
GROUP BY category
----

.Group by multiple columns
[source,sql]
----
SELECT manufacturer, category, collect(*) AS products
FROM products
GROUP BY manufacturer, category
----

.Group with distinct values
[source,sql]
----
SELECT category, collect(distinct name) AS uniqueProductNames
FROM products
GROUP BY category
----

.Group by with projection into a complex structure
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  category,
  (
    collect(name) AS productNames,
    collect((price, manufacturer) AS productDetails) AS products,
    collect(distinct manufacturer) AS uniqueManufacturers
  ) AS categoryData
FROM products
GROUP BY category
----

== Notes

* The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows with identical values in the specified columns
* All non-aggregated columns in the `SELECT` clause should appear in the `GROUP BY` clause
* When using `GROUP BY`, each column in the `SELECT` list should either be included in the `GROUP BY` clause or be used with the `collect()` function
* The `collect()` function is the primary means to create collections of values from grouped rows
* Use `collect(distinct ...)` to eliminate duplicate values in the resulting collections

== Result Transformation

When using `GROUP BY` with `collect()`, the results are transformed into a hierarchical structure. The grouping columns become fields in the result objects, and the collected values become arrays or nested objects.

This transformation is particularly useful for representing one-to-many relationships in your query results, allowing you to construct complex data structures directly from your query.

== Current Limitations

* Currently, the only aggregation supported with `GROUP BY` is collection creation using the `collect()` function
* Traditional aggregation functions like `count()`, `sum()`, `avg()`, etc. are not yet supported within grouped results
* The `total_count()` function can be used to get a count of all matching rows, but not per group
