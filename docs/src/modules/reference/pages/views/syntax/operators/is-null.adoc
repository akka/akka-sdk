= IS NULL / IS NOT NULL

The `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators check if a value is missing (NULL) or present in a column. These operators are essential for handling optional fields in your data models.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
<column_or_expression> IS NULL
<column_or_expression> IS NOT NULL
----

== Elements

`column_or_expression`::
The column or expression to check for NULL or non-NULL value.

== Features

NULL Testing::
Checks whether a value is NULL (missing) or not NULL (present).

Optional Field Handling::
Provides a way to filter results based on whether optional fields have values or not.

Three-valued Logic::
Handles the special NULL value, which is neither equal to nor different from any other value, including another NULL.

== Examples

.Find customers without a phone number
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE phoneNumber IS NULL
----

.Find customers with a phone number
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE phoneNumber IS NOT NULL
----

.Find customers with missing address information
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE address IS NULL OR address.street IS NULL
----

.Combined with other conditions
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND description IS NOT NULL
----

.Filter with nested fields
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE shippingAddress IS NOT NULL AND billingAddress IS NULL
----

== NULL in Java Types

In the View query language, NULL values correspond to specific representations in Java:

1. For primitive types (int, long, boolean, etc.), NULL is not directly representable
2. For object types (Integer, Long, Boolean, etc.), NULL is represented as `null`
3. For `Optional<T>` types, NULL is represented as an empty Optional
4. For nested objects, NULL can mean the entire object is missing

== Notes

* NULL values require special comparison operators - they cannot be compared using standard operators like `=` or `!=`
* The expression `column = NULL` will not work as expected; use `column IS NULL` instead
* Similarly, `column != NULL` will not work; use `column IS NOT NULL` instead
* NULL values in Java are represented differently based on the field type:
  ** For primitive types, default values are used (0, false, etc.)
  ** For reference types, `null` is used
  ** For `Optional<T>`, an empty Optional is used
* A NULL in a nested field can indicate either that the field itself is NULL or that a parent object is NULL
