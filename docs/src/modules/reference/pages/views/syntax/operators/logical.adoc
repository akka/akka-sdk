= Logical Operators

Logical operators combine conditions and enable complex filtering expressions. They allow you to express compound conditions by combining simpler conditions using boolean logic.

== Available Operators

[#and]
=== AND

The `AND` operator combines two conditions and returns true only when both conditions are true.

Syntax:
[source,sql]
----
<condition1> AND <condition2>
----

Examples:
[source,sql]
----
category = 'Electronics' AND price < 500
status = 'active' AND createdDate > '2023-01-01'
country = 'USA' AND state = 'California' AND city = 'San Francisco'
----

Truth table:
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Condition 1 |Condition 2 |Result

|true
|true
|true

|true
|false
|false

|false
|true
|false

|false
|false
|false
|===

[#or]
=== OR

The `OR` operator combines two conditions and returns true when either condition is true or both are true.

Syntax:
[source,sql]
----
<condition1> OR <condition2>
----

Examples:
[source,sql]
----
category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Computers'
price < 100 OR onSale = true
country = 'USA' OR country = 'Canada' OR country = 'Mexico'
----

Truth table:
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Condition 1 |Condition 2 |Result

|true
|true
|true

|true
|false
|true

|false
|true
|true

|false
|false
|false
|===

[#not]
=== NOT

The `NOT` operator negates a condition, reversing its boolean value.

Syntax:
[source,sql]
----
NOT <condition>
----

Examples:
[source,sql]
----
NOT category = 'Electronics'
NOT price > 100
NOT (address.city = 'New York' AND age > 65)
----

Truth table:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Condition |Result

|true
|false

|false
|true
|===

== Operator Precedence

In the View query language, logical operators have the following precedence (from highest to lowest):

1. NOT
2. AND
3. OR

This means that:

* `NOT a AND b` is evaluated as `(NOT a) AND b`
* `a AND b OR c` is evaluated as `(a AND b) OR c`
* `a OR b AND c` is evaluated as `a OR (b AND c)`

Use parentheses to override the default precedence:

[source,sql]
----
(category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Computers') AND price < 1000
----

== Complex Expressions

Logical operators can be combined to create complex conditions:

[source,sql]
----
(category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Computers')
AND (price < 1000 OR onSale = true)
AND NOT discontinued = true
----

== Alternative Expressions

Many complex logical expressions can be simplified using other operators:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Complex Expression |Simpler Alternative

|`category = 'A' OR category = 'B' OR category = 'C'`
|`category IN ('A', 'B', 'C')`

|`NOT a = b`
|`a != b`

|`NOT a > b`
|`a <= b`

|`NOT a < b`
|`a >= b`

|`NOT a IS NULL`
|`a IS NOT NULL`
|===

== De Morgan's Laws

These logical equivalences can help simplify negated expressions:

* `NOT (a AND b)` is equivalent to `NOT a OR NOT b`
* `NOT (a OR b)` is equivalent to `NOT a AND NOT b`

== Notes

* Use parentheses to make complex expressions more readable and to ensure the correct evaluation order
* When combining many OR conditions with the same column, consider using the IN operator instead
* For checking if a value is in an array column, use the = ANY operator
* Logical operators work with any expressions that evaluate to boolean values
