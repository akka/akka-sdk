= Operators

This page provides an overview of all operators available in the View query language. Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on values and return results.

== Comparison Operators

Comparison operators compare values and return boolean results.

|===
| Operator | Description | Example

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/comparison.adoc#equals[`=`]
| Equals
| `name = 'John'`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/comparison.adoc#not-equals[`!=`]
| Not equals
| `category != 'Electronics'`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/comparison.adoc#greater-than[`>`]
| Greater than
| `price > 100`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/comparison.adoc#greater-equals[`>=`]
| Greater than or equal to
| `price >= 100`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/comparison.adoc#less-than[`<`]
| Less than
| `price < 50`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/comparison.adoc#less-equals[`<=`]
| Less than or equal to
| `price <= 50`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/is-null.adoc[`IS NULL`]
| Tests if a value is NULL (missing)
| `phoneNumber IS NULL`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/is-null.adoc[`IS NOT NULL`]
| Tests if a value is not NULL (present)
| `email IS NOT NULL`
|===

== Logical Operators

Logical operators combine boolean expressions.

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Operator | Description | Example

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/logical.adoc#and[`AND`]
| Logical AND - true if both conditions are true
| `category = 'Books' AND price < 20`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/logical.adoc#or[`OR`]
| Logical OR - true if either condition is true
| `category = 'Books' OR category = 'Magazines'`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/logical.adoc#not[`NOT`]
| Logical NOT - negates a condition
| `NOT price > 100`
|===

== Set Membership Operators

Set membership operators check if a value is part of a set.

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Operator | Description | Example

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/in.adoc[`IN`]
| Tests if a value matches any value in a list
| `category IN ('Books', 'Magazines', 'Comics')`

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/any.adoc[`= ANY`]
| Tests if a value matches any element in an array
| `tag = ANY(tags)` or `:tag = ANY(tags)`
|===

== Pattern Matching Operators

Pattern matching operators test if a string matches a pattern.

[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Operator | Description | Example

| xref:reference:views/syntax/operators/like.adoc[`LIKE`]
| Pattern matching with wildcards
| `name LIKE 'Jo%'`
|===

== Operator Precedence

Operators are evaluated in the following order of precedence (from highest to lowest):

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Unary operators (`NOT`)
3. Comparison operators (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
4. `AND`
5. `OR`

Use parentheses to override the default precedence.
