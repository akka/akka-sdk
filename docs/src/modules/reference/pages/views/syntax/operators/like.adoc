= LIKE

The `LIKE` operator performs pattern matching on text values, allowing you to search for strings that match a specified pattern. It supports wildcards for flexible text matching.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
<column> LIKE <pattern>
----

== Elements

`column`::
The text column or expression to match against the pattern.

`pattern`::
A string pattern that can include wildcard characters:
* `%` (percent sign) - Matches any sequence of zero or more characters
* `_` (underscore) - Matches any single character

== Features

Pattern Matching::
Searches for text values that match a specific pattern with wildcards.

Prefix Matching::
Efficiently matches text that begins with a specific prefix using `'prefix%'` patterns.

Suffix Matching::
Efficiently matches text that ends with a specific suffix using `'%suffix'` patterns.

== Examples

.Match names starting with "Jo"
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE name LIKE 'Jo%'
----

.Match email addresses ending with ".com"
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE email LIKE '%.com'
----

.Match product codes with specific format (3 characters, then underscore, then 2 digits)
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE code LIKE '____%'
----

== Notes

* For index efficiency, the pattern must have a non-wildcard prefix or suffix
* Patterns like `'%text%'` (containing text anywhere) are not supported due to indexing limitations
* Only literal string patterns are supported; patterns cannot be specified as parameters
* The LIKE operation is case-sensitive unless the database is configured otherwise
* For more advanced text searching capabilities, consider using the `text_search()` function

== Indexing Requirements

For optimal performance, LIKE operations require specific index structures:

* `column LIKE 'prefix%'` - Requires a prefix index on the column
* `column LIKE '%suffix'` - Requires a suffix index on the column

Patterns that don't have a non-wildcard prefix or suffix cannot be efficiently indexed and are therefore not supported.

== Limitations

The View query language implementation of LIKE has the following limitations:

* Patterns must include a non-wildcard prefix or suffix
* Only constant patterns with literal strings are supported
* Patterns cannot be specified using parameters
* Escape characters for literal `%` or `_` are not currently supported
* Case-insensitive LIKE operations (ILIKE) are not supported
