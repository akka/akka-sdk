= View query syntax

The View query language provides a SQL-like syntax for querying and retrieving data from your views. This page provides an overview of the language features and serves as an entry point to the detailed syntax documentation.

== Overview

The View query language enables you to:

* Select specific data fields or entire objects
* Filter results based on conditions
* Join data from multiple tables
* Sort and limit results
* Create hierarchical data structures
* Paginate large result sets

== Core query components

For the complete query structure and syntax, see xref:reference:views/syntax/query.adoc[Query].

== Example queries

Here are a few examples of common query patterns:

.Basic query with filtering
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND price < 500
ORDER BY price ASC
----

.Query with pagination
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, next_page_token() AS nextPageToken
FROM products
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

.Query with grouping and collection
[source,sql]
----
SELECT category, collect(*) AS products
FROM products
GROUP BY category
----
