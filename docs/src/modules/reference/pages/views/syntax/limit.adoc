= LIMIT

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query, specifying the maximum number of results to return. It's primarily used for pagination and controlling result set size.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
LIMIT <row_count>
----

== Elements

`row_count`::
The maximum number of rows to return. This can be:
* A literal number (e.g., `10`)
* A parameter (e.g., `:pageSize`)

== Features

Result limiting::
Caps the number of rows returned by the query to improve performance and manage memory usage.

Pagination control::
When combined with `OFFSET`, enables standard pagination by specifying how many items appear on each page.

Resource optimization::
Prevents retrieving unnecessarily large result sets, improving query performance and reducing memory usage.

== Examples

=== Basic usage

.Limit to 10 rows
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
LIMIT 10
----

.Limit using a parameter
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
LIMIT :maxResults
----

=== Pagination scenarios

.Combined with OFFSET for basic pagination
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
OFFSET 20 LIMIT 10
----

.Combined with ORDER BY for consistent offset-based pagination
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
OFFSET 20 LIMIT 10
----

.Token-based pagination (note: no ORDER BY)
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, next_page_token() AS nextPageToken
FROM products
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

=== Advanced pagination examples

.Pagination with total count
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       total_count() AS totalCount
FROM products
LIMIT :pageSize
----

.Pagination with has_more indicator
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       has_more() AS hasMorePages
FROM products
LIMIT 10
----

.Complete pagination example
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       next_page_token() AS nextPageToken,
       has_more() AS hasMore,
       total_count() AS totalCount
FROM products
WHERE category = :category
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT :pageSize
----

== Implementation in Java

.Java parameter class for multiple query parameters
[source,java]
----
public record ProductsRequest(String category, int pageSize) {}
----

.Query method with a single parameter object
[source,java]
----
@Query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = :category LIMIT :pageSize")
public QueryEffect<ProductsResponse> getProductsByCategory(ProductsRequest request) {
  return queryResult();
}
----

.Response type for limited results
[source,java]
----
public record ProductsResponse(List<Product> products) {}
----

.Client usage example
[source,java]
----
// Get first 10 products
ProductsRequest request = new ProductsRequest("Electronics", 10);
ProductsResponse response = client.forView()
  .method(ProductView::getProductsByCategory)
  .invoke(request);
----

== Notes

* If no `LIMIT` is explicitly specified:
  ** A default limit of 10000 items is applied for regular queries
  ** A more restrictive default limit of 1000 items is applied when results are being projected into a collection
* These default limits help prevent accidentally retrieving extremely large result sets
* When using token-based pagination without specifying a `LIMIT`, a default page size of 100 is used
* For predictable pagination, always combine `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` when using offset-based pagination
* Results cannot be sorted with `ORDER BY` when using token-based paging (`page_token_offset`)
* Using `has_more()` with `LIMIT` can efficiently indicate if there are additional results beyond the current page
* Very large limit values may impact performance - use reasonable page sizes for better user experience
* It's generally better to explicitly specify a LIMIT value that makes sense for your use case rather than relying on the defaults

== Performance considerations

* Choose an appropriate limit size based on your use case:
  ** UI pagination: typically 10-50 items per page
  ** API responses: typically 50-100 items per page
  ** Data processing: balance between memory usage and request count
* For large data sets, consider using `has_more()` instead of `total_count()` as it's more efficient
