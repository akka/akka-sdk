= ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the query results based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order. It determines the sequence in which rows appear in the query result.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
ORDER BY <column> [ASC|DESC] [, <column> [ASC|DESC]]...
----

== Elements

`column`::
A column name or expression by which to sort the results. Multiple columns can be specified, separated by commas.

`ASC`::
Optional keyword indicating ascending order (the default if not specified). Results are sorted from lowest to highest value.

`DESC`::
Optional keyword indicating descending order. Results are sorted from highest to lowest value.

== Features

Sorting::
Arranges the result rows based on the values in the specified columns.

Multi-column Ordering::
Allows sorting by multiple columns, where the second column is used to break ties in the first column, and so on.

Direction Control::
Supports both ascending and descending order for each column independently.

== Examples

.Sort in ascending order (default)
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price
----

.Sort in descending order
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
----

.Sort by multiple columns
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY category, price DESC
----

.Sort with nested fields
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY address.city, name
----

.Sort with filtering
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
ORDER BY price ASC
----

.Sort with limiting results
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10
----

== Notes

* If no `ORDER BY` clause is specified, the results are returned in no guaranteed order
* `ASC` is the default order if not specified
* Sorting is based on the natural order for the data type of the column
* NULL values are typically placed last in ascending sorts and first in descending sorts
* When sorting by multiple columns, the order of columns in the `ORDER BY` clause determines the significance of the sort (primary, secondary, etc.)
* Performance may be affected when sorting by columns that are not indexed

== Ordering Constraints

Some order operations may be rejected if they cannot be efficiently implemented with the view's index structure. Generally, to order by a field, it should also appear in the `WHERE` conditions or be directly related to fields that do.

For example, if you filter with `WHERE category = :category`, ordering by `price` within that category would be allowed, but ordering by an unrelated field might not be supported.
