= OFFSET

The `OFFSET` clause specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from the query. It's primarily used for implementing pagination or skipping initial results.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
OFFSET <offset_value>
----

== Elements

`offset_value`::
The number of rows to skip. This can be:
* A literal number (e.g., `10`)
* A parameter (e.g., `:startFrom`)
* A page token offset (e.g., `page_token_offset(:pageToken)`)

== Features

Count-based offset::
Skips a fixed number of rows based on a numeric value, used for simple pagination.

Token-based offset::
Uses a token from a previous query to determine the offset position, providing more stable pagination when data changes between requests.

== Examples

=== Basic usage

.Skip 10 rows with a literal value
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
OFFSET 10
----

.Skip rows using a parameter
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
OFFSET :startFrom
----

=== Count-based pagination

.Basic count-based pagination
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
OFFSET 20 LIMIT 10
----

.Count-based pagination with sorting
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
OFFSET 20 LIMIT 10
----

.Count-based pagination with total count
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       total_count() AS totalCount
FROM products
ORDER BY name
OFFSET :startFrom LIMIT :pageSize
----

=== Token-based pagination

.Basic token-based pagination
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, next_page_token() AS nextPageToken
FROM products
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

.Token-based pagination with more indicators
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       next_page_token() AS nextPageToken,
       has_more() AS hasMoreProducts
FROM products
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

.Complete token-based pagination example
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       next_page_token() AS nextPageToken,
       has_more() AS hasMore,
       total_count() AS totalCount
FROM products
WHERE category = :category
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT :pageSize
----

== Implementation in Java

[source,java]
----
public record PageRequest(String category, int offset, int pageSize) {}
----

.Query method for count-based pagination
[source,java]
----
@Query("""
    SELECT * AS products,
           total_count() AS totalCount
    FROM products
    WHERE category = :category
    ORDER BY name
    OFFSET :offset LIMIT :pageSize
    """)
public QueryEffect<ProductsPage> getProductsPage(PageRequest request) {
  return queryResult();
}
----

.Response type for count-based pagination
[source,java]
----
public record ProductsPage(
  List<Product> products,
  int totalCount
) {}
----

=== Token-based pagination

.Parameter class for token-based pagination
[source,java]
----
public record TokenPageRequest(String category, String pageToken, int pageSize) {}
----

.Query method for token-based pagination
[source,java]
----
@Query("""
    SELECT * AS products,
           next_page_token() AS nextPageToken,
           has_more() AS hasMore
    FROM products
    WHERE category = :category
    OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
    LIMIT :pageSize
    """)
public QueryEffect<TokenProductsPage> getProductsWithToken(TokenPageRequest request) {
  return queryResult();
}
----

.Response type for token-based pagination
[source,java]
----
public record TokenProductsPage(
  List<Product> products,
  String nextPageToken,
  boolean hasMore
) {}
----

.Client usage for token-based pagination
[source,java]
----
// First page request uses empty token
TokenPageRequest request = new TokenPageRequest("Electronics", "", 10);
TokenProductsPage response = client.forView()
  .method(ProductView::getProductsWithToken)
  .invoke(request);

// Next page uses token from previous response
if (!response.nextPageToken().isEmpty()) {
  TokenPageRequest nextRequest = new TokenPageRequest(
    "Electronics",
    response.nextPageToken(),
    10
  );
}

== Notes

* The `offset_value` must be non-negative
* Count-based offsets (numeric literals or parameters) can lead to inconsistent results if data changes between queries
* Count-based offsets work together with `ORDER BY` to provide consistent ordering
* Token-based pagination is more resilient to data changes but does not support `ORDER BY`
* For token-based pagination, use an empty string as the token for the first page request
* With token-based pagination, the last page is reached when an empty token is returned
* Token-based pagination is generally preferred for production applications dealing with frequently changing data

== Performance considerations

* Token-based pagination typically provides better performance for deep pagination (many pages into the result set)
* Consider using token-based pagination for mobile applications and APIs where data consistency between requests is important
* For user interfaces that need to show specific page numbers, count-based offsets may still be necessary
* If showing total counts, be aware that computing the count may be expensive for large result sets
