= AS

The `AS` keyword creates aliases for columns, expressions, tables, or functions in a query. Aliases provide meaningful names for the query results and are essential for mapping query results to Java objects in the View response.

== Syntax

Column or expression alias:
[source,sql]
----
<column_or_expression> AS <alias>
----

Table alias:
[source,sql]
----
<table_name> AS <alias>
----

== Elements

`column_or_expression`::
A column name, function, or expression that you want to alias.

`table_name`::
The name of a table that you want to alias.

`alias`::
A new name to assign to the column, expression, or table. This name will be used in the query result and should match field names in your Java response types.

== Features

Result mapping::
Maps columns or expressions in the query result to fields in your Java response types, ensuring proper deserialization.

Column renaming::
Renames columns in the result set to match the required field names or to make them more meaningful.

Structuring results::
When used with composite expressions, enables creation of nested objects and structured data in the result.

Table references::
Creates shorter or more meaningful names for tables, especially useful in joins and complex queries.

== Examples

=== Basic column aliases

.Simple column alias
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name AS customerName FROM customers
----

.Alias for a nested field
[source,sql]
----
SELECT address.city AS customerCity FROM customers
----

.Multiple aliases in a single query
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  id,
  name AS customerName,
  email AS contactEmail,
  status
FROM customers
----

=== Aliases for special elements

.Alias for a collection
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products FROM products
----

.Alias for a parameter
[source,sql]
----
SELECT :requestId AS requestId, name FROM customers
----

.Alias for a function result
[source,sql]
----
SELECT next_page_token() AS nextPageToken FROM products
----

=== Aliases for nested structures

.Simple nested object
[source,sql]
----
SELECT (name, email) AS contactInfo FROM customers
----

.Complex nested object with custom field names
[source,sql]
----
SELECT (
  name AS fullName,
  email AS emailAddress,
  phone AS phoneNumber
) AS contactDetails
FROM customers
----

.Multiple nested objects
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  id,
  (name, email) AS contactInfo,
  (address.street, address.city, address.zipCode) AS location
FROM customers
----

.Nested object with collections
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  category,
  (
    collect(name) AS productNames,
    collect(price) AS pricePoints
  ) AS categoryData
FROM products
GROUP BY category
----

=== Table aliases

.Basic table alias in JOIN
[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, o.id
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

.Multiple table aliases in complex joins
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  c.name,
  o.id AS orderId,
  p.name AS productName
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
JOIN products AS p ON p.id = o.productId
----

== Java type mapping

The alias names in your query must match the field names in your Java response types. For example:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  id,
  name AS customerName,
  (address.street, address.city) AS location
FROM customers
----

Should match a Java type like:

[source,java]
----
public record CustomerResponse(
  String id,
  String customerName,
  Location location
) {}

public record Location(
  String street,
  String city
) {}
----

For collection results:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT category, collect(name) AS productNames
FROM products
GROUP BY category
----

Maps to:

[source,java]
----
public record CategorySummary(
  String category,
  List<String> productNames
) {}
----

== Alias requirements and constraints

=== When aliases are required

Aliases are mandatory in the following cases:

* For composite expressions: `(name, email) AS contactInfo`
* For special functions: `next_page_token() AS nextPageToken`
* When collecting items: `collect(name) AS productNames`
* When using wildcards with a specific field name: `* AS items`

=== Naming constraints

* Alias names must be valid Java identifiers
* Alias names are case-sensitive and should match your Java field names exactly
* Reserved words should be avoided or enclosed in backticks
* If alias names contain special characters or spaces, they must be enclosed in backticks

== Notes

* Aliases defined in the SELECT clause can't be referenced in WHERE clauses
* Table aliases can be referenced in SELECT, WHERE, and ON clauses
* Aliases are primarily for result mapping and don't affect the underlying data
* For complex nested structures, ensure that your Java classes have matching structure
* The mapping between SQL aliases and Java fields is case-sensitive
