= page_token_offset()

The `page_token_offset()` function implements token-based pagination by using an opaque token from a previous query to determine the starting position for the current query. This approach provides more stable pagination when underlying data changes between page requests.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
OFFSET page_token_offset(:parameter_name)
----

== Elements

`:parameter_name`::
The parameter containing the page token. This token is typically obtained from the `next_page_token()` function in a previous query result.

== Features

Token-based Pagination::
Enables cursor-based pagination that maintains consistency even when data changes between page requests.

Stable Paging::
Prevents the skipping or duplication of results that can occur with numeric offsets when data is added or removed between page requests.

Context Preservation::
The token encapsulates information about the exact position in the result set, including sort order and filter conditions.

== Examples

.Basic token-based pagination
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, next_page_token() AS nextPageToken
FROM products
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

.Token-based pagination with sorting
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, next_page_token() AS nextPageToken
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

.Complete pagination example with has_more check
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       next_page_token() AS nextPageToken,
       has_more() AS hasMoreProducts
FROM products
WHERE category = :category
ORDER BY price ASC
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

== Usage Flow

1. *First Page Request*: For the first page request, use an empty string as the token value:
+
[source,java]
----
String pageToken = ""; // Empty string for first page
----

2. *Process Response*: The query response includes results and a next page token:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "products": [...],
  "nextPageToken": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOjEwLCJzb3J0IjoicHJpY2UgREVTQyJ9"
}
----

3. *Request Next Page*: Use the received token for the next page request:
+
[source,java]
----
String pageToken = response.nextPageToken(); // Token from previous response
----

4. *Detect Last Page*: When the last page is reached, an empty token is returned:
+
[source,java]
----
if (response.nextPageToken().isEmpty()) {
    // Last page reached
}
----

== Notes

* The page token is an opaque string and should be treated as a black box - do not attempt to parse or modify it
* For the first page request, use an empty string as the page token
* When the last page is reached, an empty string is returned as the next page token
* Tokens are specific to a particular query structure - changing the query conditions or sort order invalidates existing tokens
* If no `LIMIT` is specified with `page_token_offset()`, a default page size of 100 is used
