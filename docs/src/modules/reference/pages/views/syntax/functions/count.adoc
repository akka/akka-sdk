= count(*)

The `count(*)` function returns the number of rows that match the query criteria. In the current implementation, it has specific limitations and usage restrictions.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
count(*) [AS alias]
----

== Elements

`AS alias`::
Optional aliasing for the count result in the query response. If not specified, the count will be available in a field with an implementation-defined name.

== Features

Row Counting::
Counts all rows that match the query's WHERE conditions.

== Current Limitations

In the current implementation, the `count(*)` function has several important limitations:

Limited Use Cases::
The `count(*)` function can only be used for counting all matching rows in a simple query, similar to `total_count()`. It cannot be used with `GROUP BY` for counting rows per group.

Not for Aggregation::
Unlike in standard SQL, `count(*)` cannot currently be used as an aggregation function within grouped results.

No Distinct Support::
`count(distinct column)` syntax is not currently supported.

No Column Counting::
`count(column_name)` for counting non-NULL values is not currently supported.

== Examples

.Basic usage
[source,sql]
----
SELECT count(*) AS customerCount FROM customers
----

.With WHERE condition
[source,sql]
----
SELECT count(*) AS activeCustomers FROM customers WHERE status = 'active'
----

== Future Enhancements

Future versions of the View query language may include:

* Support for `count(*)` within `GROUP BY` clauses
* Support for `count(distinct column)` syntax
* Support for `count(column_name)` to count non-NULL values
* Additional aggregation functions like `sum()`, `avg()`, `min()`, and `max()`

== Notes

* For total counts with pagination, prefer using the `total_count()` function which is specifically designed for this purpose
* For checking if additional pages exist, use the `has_more()` function
