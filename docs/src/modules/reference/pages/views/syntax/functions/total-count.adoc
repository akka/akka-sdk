= total_count()

The `total_count()` function returns the total number of rows that match a query's conditions, regardless of pagination settings. This allows applications to display the total result count and calculate the total number of pages.

== Syntax

[source,sql]
----
total_count() [AS alias]
----

== Elements

`AS alias`::
Optional aliasing for the count result in the query response. If not specified, the count will be available in a field named `totalCount`.

== Features

Total Results Count::
Returns the total number of rows that match the query conditions, irrespective of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses.

Pagination Information::
Enables applications to display pagination information like "Showing 1-10 of 237 results" or to calculate the total number of pages.

Same Query Conditions::
The total count is calculated using the same filter conditions as the main query, ensuring consistency.

== Examples

.Basic usage without an alias
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, total_count()
FROM products
LIMIT 10
----

.With a custom alias
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, total_count() AS totalProducts
FROM products
LIMIT 10
----

.Combined with token-based pagination
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       next_page_token() AS nextPageToken,
       total_count() AS totalCount
FROM products
OFFSET page_token_offset(:pageToken)
LIMIT 10
----

.With filtering and other pagination info
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products,
       total_count() AS totalCount,
       has_more() AS hasMore
FROM products
WHERE category = :category
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 10
----

== Usage Flow

1. *Include in Query*: Add the function to your SELECT clause, optionally with an alias:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * AS products, total_count() AS totalCount
----

2. *Response Structure*: Define a response type that includes the count:
+
[source,java]
----
public record ProductsResponse(List<Product> products, int totalCount) {}
----

3. *Pagination Logic*: Use the total count for pagination calculations:
+
[source,java]
----
int totalPages = (int) Math.ceil((double) response.totalCount() / pageSize);
boolean isLastPage = (currentPage == totalPages);
String paginationText = String.format(
    "Showing %d-%d of %d results",
    startIndex + 1,
    Math.min(startIndex + pageSize, response.totalCount()),
    response.totalCount()
);
----

== Notes

* The `total_count()` function computes the total number of rows that match the query conditions
* Computing the total count may add some overhead to query execution, especially for large result sets
* The count is calculated after WHERE conditions are applied but before any LIMIT or OFFSET
* The function can be combined with both count-based and token-based pagination
* For very large result sets, consider if displaying an exact count is necessary or if pagination controls can work with just `has_more()` information

== Performance Considerations

The `total_count()` function requires counting all matching rows in the view, which can be resource-intensive for large result sets. Consider the following approaches to optimize performance:

* Only include `total_count()` when the count is actually needed by the client
* Use `has_more()` instead when you only need to know if additional pages exist
* Consider caching the total count if it doesn't change frequently
* For large datasets, approximate counts might be sufficient for UI purposes
