= View Concepts

This section covers the key concepts that underpin Akka Views, explaining how they work and how to use them effectively in your applications.

== Core Concepts

=== Data Structure and Access

* xref:reference:views/concepts/table-updaters.adoc[Table Updaters] - The fundamental building blocks of Views, defining data sources and table structures
* xref:reference:views/concepts/data-types.adoc[Data Types] - The supported data types in Views and how they map between Java and the query language
* xref:reference:views/concepts/result-mapping.adoc[Result Mapping] - How query results are transformed into Java objects in your application

=== Specialized Data Handling

* xref:reference:views/concepts/optional-fields.adoc[Optional Fields] - Working with values that may or may not be present
* xref:reference:views/concepts/array-types.adoc[Array Types] - Handling collections of values within a single view row

=== Advanced Features

* xref:reference:views/concepts/advanced-views.adoc[Advanced Views] - Creating sophisticated views with multiple tables, joins, and complex data structures

== Understanding Views

Views in Akka provide a flexible way to access your data using patterns beyond simple key-based lookups. They create queryable projections of your entities that can be optimized for specific access patterns.

=== How Views Work

1. **Data Consumption**: Views subscribe to events or state changes from entities or topics
2. **Transformation**: These events/changes are transformed into rows in view tables
3. **Indexing**: Views automatically create indexes based on your queries
4. **Querying**: The view query language allows you to retrieve and filter this data

=== View Benefits

* **Flexible Access Patterns**: Access data by any field, not just entity IDs
* **Optimized Queries**: Views create indexes for efficient querying based on your needs
* **Joined Data**: Combine data from multiple entities into unified query results
* **Custom Projections**: Transform entity data into formats optimized for reading

=== View Characteristics

* **Eventually Consistent**: Views are eventually consistent with their source entities
* **Read Optimized**: Views are designed for efficient reading, not for updates
* **Declarative Definition**: Views are defined by their queries and transformations
* **Automatic Maintenance**: Updates to views happen automatically as entities change

== From Entity to View

Understanding the relationship between entities and views is key to effective modeling:

=== Entity Focus vs. View Focus

* **Entities**: Focus on business logic, command handling, and state consistency
* **Views**: Focus on data access patterns, querying, and read optimizations

=== Data Flow

1. Clients send commands to entities
2. Entities process commands and emit events or state changes
3. Views consume these events/changes and update their tables
4. Clients query views to read data in the desired format

=== Creating Effective Views

* Define views based on access patterns in your application
* Consider different views for different query needs
* Design your table structure and queries together
* Balance normalization and denormalization based on query patterns
