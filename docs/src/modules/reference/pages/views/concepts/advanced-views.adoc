= Advanced Views

Advanced Views in Akka provide sophisticated features for complex data access patterns, including multi-table joins, complex projections, and hierarchical data structures. This page explains these advanced capabilities and how to use them effectively.

== Multi-Table Views

A key feature of Advanced Views is the ability to define multiple tables in a single View component and perform joins across them.

=== Defining Multiple Tables

Multiple tables are defined by creating multiple `TableUpdater` classes within a View:

[source,java]
----
@Component(id = "shop-view")
public class ShopView extends View {

  @Table("customers")
  @Consume.FromEventSourcedEntity(CustomerEntity.class)
  public static class Customers extends TableUpdater<Customer> {
    // Customer transformation methods
  }

  @Table("products")
  @Consume.FromEventSourcedEntity(ProductEntity.class)
  public static class Products extends TableUpdater<Product> {
    // Product transformation methods
  }

  @Table("orders")
  @Consume.FromKeyValueEntity(OrderEntity.class)
  public static class Orders extends TableUpdater<Order> {
    // Order transformation methods
  }

  // Query methods with joins
}
----

Each `TableUpdater` class:

1. Is annotated with `@Table` to specify the table name
2. Has its own data source annotation (`@Consume.From...`)
3. Defines its own row structure with the generic type parameter
4. Can have its own transformation methods

=== Joining Tables

Once multiple tables are defined, you can join them in queries:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT customers.*, orders.*
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON orders.customerId = customers.id
WHERE customers.id = :customerId
----

This retrieves customer data along with their orders in a single query.

== Join Types

Advanced Views support several join types:

=== INNER JOIN

Returns only rows that have matching values in both tables:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, o.id, o.amount
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

Only customers who have placed orders will appear in the result.

=== LEFT JOIN

Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, o.id, o.amount
FROM customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

All customers appear in the result, even those without orders (with NULL order fields).

=== RIGHT JOIN

Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, o.id, o.amount
FROM customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

All orders appear in the result, even if the customer no longer exists (with NULL customer fields).

=== FULL JOIN

Returns rows when there is a match in either table:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, o.id, o.amount
FROM customers AS c
FULL JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

Shows all customers and all orders, with NULL fields where there is no match.

== Complex Data Projections

Advanced Views enable complex data projections to create custom result structures:

=== Restructuring Fields

Select and rename fields from multiple tables:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name AS customerName,
  o.id AS orderId,
  o.amount AS orderAmount
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

=== Creating Nested Objects

Group related fields into nested objects:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  (o.id, o.amount, o.date) AS orderDetails
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

=== Custom Field Names in Nested Objects

Specify field names within nested objects:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  (o.id AS identifier, o.amount AS total, o.date AS ordered) AS orderDetails
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
----

== Hierarchical Data Structures

Advanced Views excel at creating hierarchical data structures that represent one-to-many relationships:

=== Nested Collections

Combine joins with `GROUP BY` and `collect()` to create nested collections:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  collect(o.*) AS orders
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
----

This creates a hierarchical structure with customer information and a nested collection of their orders.

=== Multi-level Nesting

Create complex hierarchies with multiple levels of nesting:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  collect((o.id, o.date, collect((i.productId, i.quantity) AS items) AS orderItems) AS order) AS orders
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
JOIN order_items AS i ON i.orderId = o.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, o.id, o.date
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
----

This creates a three-level hierarchy: customers → orders → order items.

== Multiple Data Sources

Advanced Views can combine data from different types of sources:

=== Mixed Entity Types

Combine Event Sourced Entities with Key Value Entities:

[source,java]
----
@Table("customers")
@Consume.FromEventSourcedEntity(CustomerEntity.class)
public static class Customers extends TableUpdater<Customer> { }

@Table("sessions")
@Consume.FromKeyValueEntity(SessionEntity.class)
public static class Sessions extends TableUpdater<Session> { }
----

=== Combining Entities and Topics

Mix entity data with data from topics:

[source,java]
----
@Table("customers")
@Consume.FromEventSourcedEntity(CustomerEntity.class)
public static class Customers extends TableUpdater<Customer> { }

@Table("notifications")
@Consume.FromTopic("customer-notifications")
public static class Notifications extends TableUpdater<Notification> { }
----

== Advanced Filtering

Advanced Views support sophisticated filtering:

=== Complex Join Conditions

Join tables with multiple conditions:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.*, o.*
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id AND o.status = 'active'
----

=== Filtering in Multiple Places

Apply filters at different stages of the query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, collect(p.*)
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
JOIN order_items AS i ON i.orderId = o.id
JOIN products AS p ON p.id = i.productId
WHERE c.status = 'active' AND o.date > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY c.name
----

== Enabling Advanced Views

Advanced View features are not available by default in deployed services:

* For local development and testing, advanced features are available automatically
* For deployed services, contact the Akka support team to enable advanced view features

== Best Practices

=== Performance Considerations

* Be mindful of join complexity - very complex joins may impact performance
* Consider indexing strategies for columns used in join conditions
* Use appropriate join types to avoid unnecessary data processing
* Test queries with realistic data volumes

=== Design Guidelines

* Group related tables in a single View component
* Use clear naming conventions for tables and fields
* Document the relationships between tables
* Create response types that match the hierarchical structure of your queries
* Use table aliases to make complex queries more readable

=== Modeling Tips

* Use nested objects for related fields that always appear together
* Use collections for one-to-many relationships
* Consider normalization vs. denormalization tradeoffs based on query patterns
* Design your table structures based on access patterns, not just entity structure

== Examples

=== E-Commerce Example

Model:

[source,java]
----
// Customer data
public record Customer(String id, String name, String email, Address address) { }
public record Address(String street, String city, String zipCode, String country) { }

// Product data
public record Product(String id, String name, String description, double price) { }

// Order data
public record Order(String id, String customerId, Instant orderDate, String status) { }
public record OrderItem(String orderId, String productId, int quantity, double price) { }
----

View with multiple tables:

[source,java]
----
@Component(id = "shop-view")
public class ShopView extends View {

  @Table("customers")
  @Consume.FromEventSourcedEntity(CustomerEntity.class)
  public static class Customers extends TableUpdater<Customer> { }

  @Table("products")
  @Consume.FromEventSourcedEntity(ProductEntity.class)
  public static class Products extends TableUpdater<Product> { }

  @Table("orders")
  @Consume.FromEventSourcedEntity(OrderEntity.class)
  public static class Orders extends TableUpdater<Order> { }

  @Table("order_items")
  @Consume.FromKeyValueEntity(OrderItemEntity.class)
  public static class OrderItems extends TableUpdater<OrderItem> { }

  @Query("""
    SELECT
      c.name,
      c.email,
      (c.address.street, c.address.city, c.address.zipCode) AS shippingAddress,
      collect(
        (o.id AS orderId,
         o.orderDate,
         collect(
           (p.name, i.quantity, i.price) AS item
         ) AS items
        )
      ) AS orders
    FROM customers AS c
    JOIN orders AS o ON o.customerId = c.id
    JOIN order_items AS i ON i.orderId = o.id
    JOIN products AS p ON p.id = i.productId
    WHERE c.id = :customerId
    GROUP BY o.id, o.orderDate
    GROUP BY c.name, c.email, c.address
    """)
  public QueryEffect<CustomerOrderDetails> getCustomerOrderDetails(String customerId) {
    return queryResult();
  }
}
----

Response types:

[source,java]
----
public record CustomerOrderDetails(
    String name,
    String email,
    ShippingAddress shippingAddress,
    List<OrderDetail> orders
) { }

public record ShippingAddress(
    String street,
    String city,
    String zipCode
) { }

public record OrderDetail(
    String orderId,
    Instant orderDate,
    List<OrderItem> items
) { }

public record OrderItem(
    String name,
    int quantity,
    double price
) { }
----
