These versions also consistently upgrade to *Jackson 2.18.3*.

As reference of versions that go together for Akka 25.05, please see https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-dependencies/25.05/[Akka module versions 25.05].

== Virtual thread dispatchers on Java 21

Akka now supports configuring a dispatcher to run on virtual threads when executing on JVM 21 or later. This is useful for isolated dispatchers for blocking
operations as it allows a much higher number of concurrent blocking tasks than a thread-pool-based dispatcher.


For more details see https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/dispatchers.html#solution-virtual-threads-dispatcher-for-blocking-operations[the blocking operations section of the docs]
and https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/v2.10.5/akka-actor/src/main/resources/reference.conf#L547[reference.conf]

Note that the virtual thread dispatcher is not generally suitable as an actor dispatcher because of its overhead.

== Store arbitrary metadata with events for Event Sourced entities

It is now possible to store additional metadata together with the events persisted by an Event Sourced entity
implemented with the `EventSourcedBehavior` and replicated Event Sourcing APIs for journals that support metadata using
the new `persistWithMetadata()` effects.

The metadata can then be accessed by queries and projections through the event envelope `metadata[T]` for Scala and `getMetadata(Class<T>)` for Java.

== License key

Akka requires a license key for use in production.
