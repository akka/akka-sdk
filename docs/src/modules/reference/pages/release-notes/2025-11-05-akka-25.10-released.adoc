The following CVE’s are addressed in this build.

* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53393[CVE-2025-53393]

== Bug fixes

 * Java server logic always invoked on the specified execution context in akka-grpc

== Other improvements

 * API for specifying restart settings for projections
 * Internal Java projection callbacks on Akka dispatcher

== Dependency updates

 * Kafka Clients 4.1.0
 * Scala 2.13.17 and 3.3.7
 * r2dbc-postgresql 1.1.0

== Compatibility

* All modules of Akka 25.10 are backwards compatible with Akka 25.05.
* No configuration changes are needed.
* Rolling update of Akka Cluster is fully supported.

Akka libraries now depend on Scala 2.13.17. Because of this, Scala sbt projects on Scala 2.13 will need to bump their Scala version to 2.13.7 to avoid errors from sbt.
