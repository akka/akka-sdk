== New features

For deeper insight into some of these new features, please visit the https://www.lightbend.com/blog[Lightbend blog], which will be featuring a new feature weekly for the next month.

The noteworthy features are:

* https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-distributed-cluster/current/index.html[Akka Distributed Cluster] is a set of features that will help you with stretching an Akka Cluster over geographically distributed locations, and provides asynchronous communication between different Akka Microservices without using a message broker.
It comes with new features such as:
 ** Projections over gRPC -- asynchronous brokerless service-to-service communication.
 ** Replicated Event Sourcing over gRPC -- active-active entities.
 ** Dynamic event filters that can be defined on both the producer and on the consumer side, and they can be changed at runtime.
* https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-management/current/rolling-updates.html#kubernetes-rolling-updates[Improved rolling updates in Kubernetes] by defining Pod deletion cost corresponding to Akka Cluster member age and Akka Cluster `app-version` from Kubernetes revision.
* https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/cluster-sharded-daemon-process.html#dynamic-scaling-of-number-of-workers[Dynamic scaling of number of Sharded Daemon Processes], e.g.
Projection instances.
* Storing a https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-persistence-r2dbc/current/durable-state-store.html[query representation of Durable State] without using asynchronous Projection processing.

* Using https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/remote-security.html#mtls-with-rotated-certificates-in-kubernetes[Akka Cluster with mTLS and rotated certificates in Kubernetes].
* Scala 3 support in:
 ** Akka HTTP
 ** Akka gRPC
 ** Akka Management
 ** Akka Persistence R2DBC
 ** Akka Persistence Cassandra
 ** Akka Projections (some modules)
 ** Alpakka Kafka
 ** Alpakka (some modules)
 ** Akka Diagnostics
* https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-diagnostics/current/[Akka Diagnostics] with Thread Starvation Detector and Config Checker.
* https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/distributed-data.html#expire[Automatic expiry of Distributed Data entries] and https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/distributed-data.html#subscribe[subscribe to entries with wildcard naming].
This is useful for building cache like data structures with Distributed Data.

== Compatibility

Akka 2.8.x is compatible with Akka 2.7.x and 2.6.x aside from removal of two deprecated modules:

* Classic Remoting transport has been deprecated since Akka 2.6.0 (2019-11-06) and is replaced by the Artery transport, which has been the default since 2.6.0 and declared ready for production in Akka 2.5.22 (2019-04-03).
* OSGi packaging and support in Akka has been dropped.

By compatible, we mean:

* Akka 2.8.x is binary backwards compatible with 2.7.x and 2.6.x, i.e.
a library built with Akka 2.6.x can still be used with an application using Akka 2.8.x.
* No configuration changes are needed for updating an application from Akka 2.6.x or 2.7.x to 2.8.x.
* Rolling update of Akka Cluster from Akka 2.6.x or 2.7.x to 2.8.x is fully supported.

Other modules included in Akka 23.05 are also compatible with their previous version.
