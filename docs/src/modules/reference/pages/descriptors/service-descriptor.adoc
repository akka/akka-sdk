== Akka Service descriptor

A _Service Descriptor_ in Akka defines the configuration for a service resource. This is used by the `akka service apply command` for deploying a service together with a detailed configuration. Below is the detailed reference for each part of the service descriptor and its fields.

The Service Descriptor is used by the `akka service apply` command, described in xref:operations:services/deploy-service.adoc#apply[deploying a service with a descriptor].

=== ServiceJwt

The JWT configuration allows a service to manage token signing and validation. Keys are prioritized for matching tokens.

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Field      |Type              |Description

|*keys*     |[]<<JwtKey>>
a| List of JWT keys for signing and validation. Order matters.

|===

The order of *keys* is important. When signing or validating, the first matching key will be used, according to the following rules.

For validating:

* The list is first filtered by all keys capable of validating - that is, any keys for the HMAC algorithm, or any keys for an asymmetric algorithm that have the public key defined.
* If the token being validated defines an issuer (iss), and there is at least one key that has that issuer defined, then the list is filtered to only include keys from that issuer. Otherwise, all keys capable of validating remain as candidates.
* The list is then filtered matching the algorithm. The algorithm only has to match by key type, that is, by HMAC, RSA, ECDSA or EdDSA. So a key that has an algorithm of HS256 can be used to validate a token signed by an algorithm of HS512.
* If at this point, there are still multiple keys remaining, then the first key that matches the key id (kid) parameter, if defined, in the token is used, otherwise, the first key of the remaining keys is used.

For signing:

* The list is first filtered by all keys capable of signing - that is, any keys for the HMAC algorithm, or any keys for an asymmetric algorithm that have the private key defined.
* If the token to be signed contains an issuer claim (iss), and there is at least one key that has that same issuer defined, then the list is filtered to only include the keys with that issuer, otherwise, all keys capable of signing remain as candidates. The first key out of the remaining keys is used.


=== JwtKey

A key that can be used for Akka's JWT support.

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Field       |Type              |Description

|*keyId*     |string _required_
a|The id of the key.

When signing, it will be placed in the key id parameter (kid) of the JWT header. It may be used for matching incoming keys when validating. It is important that, for a given issuer, if two keys have the same id, that those keys must be the same key.

Ideally, key ids should be unique across all services.

The key id allows JWT keys to be rotated: a new key can be configured with a lower priority on all services that use it. Once that change is pushed out, then the key's priority, i.e., the order in the list, can be increased so that it is now the key that gets used for signing. Finally, once all JWTs signed by the old key have expired, the old key can be removed.
|*issuer*    |string
a|The issuer of tokens that use this key.

If a token being signed or validated contains an issuer (iss) claim, this will be matched against it. This allows multiple keys for different issuers to be provisioned without conflicting.

Setting this parameter is also important if you have keys from multiple issuers, but you don't trust that one of them won't try and spoof the other. Since it pins a particular set of keys to only be used to validate that issuer's token, if the other tries to spoof it, validation will fail.
|*algorithm* |string _required_
a|The algorithm to use this key for.

When validating, this secret may be used if the secret for this algorithm is compatible with the algorithm that the token being validated was signed with.

Valid values are:

* `HMD5` - HMAC with MD5
* `HS224` - HMAC with SHA224
* `HS256` - HMAC with SHA256
* `HS384` - HMAC with SHA384
* `HS512` - HMAC with SHA512
* `RS256` - RSA with SHA256
* `RS384` - RSA with SHA384
* `RS512` - RSA with SHA512
* `ES256` - Elliptic Curve DSA with SHA256
* `ES384` - Elliptic Curve DSA with SHA384
* `ES512` - Elliptic Curve DSA with SHA512
* `Ed25519` - Edward's Curve DSA
|*secret*    |<<ObjectRef>> _required_
a|The configured secret to use for signing or validating.

This must be a reference to a secret. The secret must have the following keys defined, depending on the algorithm used:

* HMAC algorithms - a key named `secret.key`, containing the bytes of the secret.
* Asymmetric algorithms - One or both of `private.key` and `public.key`. If only a `private.key` is supplied, the key will only be used for signing, if only a public key is supplied, the key will only be used for validating. The public key must be formatted as an X.509 PEM public key (with a header, `BEGIN PUBLIC KEY`). The private key must be a PEM PKCS-8 key encoded (with a header, `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`) according to the algorithm the secret is used for. Alternatively, for RSA algorithms, RSA private keys may be PEM PKCS-1 encoded (with a header, `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`). The keys must not be encrypted. For ECDSA keys, EC key encoding (`BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY`) is not supported, and PKCS-8 must be used instead.
