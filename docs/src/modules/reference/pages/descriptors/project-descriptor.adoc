== Akka Project descriptor

Akka's _Project Descriptor_ is a multi-document YAML file that defines the complete configuration for an Akka project, including

. xref:#project[the project itself],
. xref:#service[services],
. xref:#route[routes],
. xref:#observability[observability settings],
. xref:#external-secret[external secrets],
. xref:#secret[secrets],
. xref:#service-config[service configs],
. xref:#broker[message broker configuration], and
. xref:#rolebindings[role bindings].

This allows you to manage multiple resources in a single file and apply them at once with the `akka project apply` command.

Each document in the project descriptor represents a single resource and follows a common structure:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Field   |Type                    |Description

|*resource*         |string _required_  |The type of resource: `Project`, `Service`, `Route`, `Observability`, `ExternalSecret`, `Secret`, `ServiceConfig`, `Broker`, or `RoleBindings`
|*resourceVersion*  |string _required_  |The version of the resource schema. Currently only `v1` is supported.
|*metadata*         |<<Metadata>>       |Optional metadata for the resource. Required for `Project`, `Service`, `Route`, `ExternalSecret`, `Secret`, and `ServiceConfig` resources.
|*spec*             |object _required_  |The specification for the resource. Structure depends on the resource type.
|===

=== Metadata

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Field    |Type     |Description

|*name*   |string   |The name of the resource. Required for `Project`, `Service`, `Route`, `ExternalSecret`, `Secret`, and `ServiceConfig` resources.
|*region* |string   |The target region for region-specific resources. Supported for `ExternalSecret`, `Secret`, and `ServiceConfig`. When set, the resource is applied only to the specified region with regional sync mode.
|===

== Resource types

The project descriptor supports the following resource types. A single descriptor can contain multiple `Service`, `Route`, `ExternalSecret`, `Secret`, and `ServiceConfig` documents, each with a unique name. The `Project`, `Observability`, `Broker`, and `RoleBindings` resources are project-level singletons—only one of each can exist per project.

[#project]
=== Project

Defines the project itself, including its name, description, regions, and organization. If present, it must be the first document in the descriptor. When applied, the project is created if it does not exist, or updated if it does (description changes, regions added or removed).

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Field           |Type              |Description

|*description*   |string            |A description for the project.
|*organization*  |string            |The organization that owns the project. Can also be specified via `--organization` flag or `akka config set organization`.
|*regions*       |[]string          |List of regions for the project. The first region is the primary region. Can also be specified via `--project-regions` flag.
|===

NOTE: You cannot specify both a `Project` resource in the descriptor and the `--project` flag. Use one or the other to identify the project.

== Using the project descriptor

[#exporting]
=== Exporting the descriptor for an existing project

To export all resources from an existing project as a descriptor:

[source,bash]
----
akka project export --project my-project --file my-project.yaml
----

This exports the project configuration, services, routes, secrets, service configs, observability configuration, broker settings, and role bindings to a single file. You can also write to standard output:

[source,bash]
----
akka project export > project.yaml
----

The exported descriptor can be used as a starting point for version-controlled infrastructure, or to replicate a project's configuration.

IMPORTANT: Secret values are redacted in the exported descriptor. Secret data is replaced with `NOT EXPORTED` placeholders to prevent accidental exposure. You must replace these placeholders with actual values before re-applying the descriptor.

[#applying]
=== Applying a project descriptor

To configure the project according to the descriptor, use the `akka project apply` command.

==== Dry-run validation

The `--dry-run` flag validates a descriptor and shows what would be applied without making any changes:

[source,bash]
----
akka project apply --file project.yaml --dry-run
----

Dry-run performs the following validations:

- Schema validation for all resource types
- Cross-resource reference checking — for example, if a Service references `serviceConfig: my-config`, dry-run verifies that `my-config` exists either as a `ServiceConfig` document in the same descriptor or as an existing resource in the project
- Secret references are validated the same way
- Region names are validated against the project's available regions

==== Applying

To apply a project descriptor:

[source,bash]
----
akka project apply --file project.yaml
----

This command will create or update all resources defined in the descriptor. Resources are processed in order, and the command will report which resources were created, updated, or skipped.

IMPORTANT: The apply operation is additive. It creates or updates resources defined in the descriptor, but does not remove resources that are absent from the file. If you previously applied a descriptor with three services and then apply a new version with only two services, the third service will remain deployed. To remove a resource, use the appropriate `akka` CLI delete command (e.g., `akka service delete`).

NOTE: For multi-region projects, the descriptor is applied to the primary region. Changes will then be synchronized to other regions automatically.

==== Reading from standard input

You can also pipe the descriptor content:

[source,bash]
----
cat project.yaml | akka project apply --file -
----

This is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines where secret values are injected from environment variables. Keep the descriptor in source control as a template with placeholders, and substitute values at apply time:

[source,yaml]
----
resource: Secret
resourceVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-credentials
spec:
  type: generic
  data:
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
----

[source,bash]
----
envsubst < project.yaml | akka project apply --file -
----

This way the descriptor never contains actual secret values — they are resolved from the CI environment at apply time.
