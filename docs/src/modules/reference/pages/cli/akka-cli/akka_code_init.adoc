= akka code init

Initialize a new Akka SDK project.

== Synopsis

The `akka code init` command helps you get started quickly with the Akka SDK by walking you through a simple, interactive setup process.

It allows you to:

* Select and clone one of the official Akka sample projects from https://github.com/akka-samples/
* Download and install the Akka AI context
* Display configuration instruction for your preferred AI assistance (Copilot, Cursor, Qodo)

The command will create a new directory with the specified name in the current working directory.
