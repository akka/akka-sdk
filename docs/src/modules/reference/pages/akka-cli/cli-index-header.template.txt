= List of `akka` commands

The `akka` command line tool enables you to interact with your Akka projects and services using the command line. See xref:akka-cli:installation.adoc[] for information on how to download `akka`. Use xref:reference:akka-cli/akka_version.adoc[`akka version`] to check the version.

The following sections list xref:reference:akka-cli/akka.adoc[akka] commands and their options.

== Log in to Akka
By default, `akka auth login` will launch your web browser and take you to the proper URL to enter your credentials. The command-line client will print "Waiting for UI login..." and pause while this happens, and then resume with a message once it receives the authorization token from the Akka server.

You can, optionally, provide the `--no-launch-browser` flag with the `akka auth` command (e.g. `akka auth login --no-launch-browser auth`), in which case
the command-line client will simply display the URL you can use for the authorization. This option is helpful if, for some reason, the command-line client is unable to launch your browser for you. The Akka CLI will wait until you complete the login before continuing.

The xref:reference:akka-cli/akka_auth.adoc[] command offers these options:

<AKKA_AUTH_CMD>
