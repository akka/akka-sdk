= Security announcements
include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Licensing Akka libraries ensures organizations that the versions of Akka libraries they are running in production will have all the latest known vulnerabilities patched and maintain compliance with SOC 2 standards. See https://www.lightbend.com/akka/compliance[Akka Compliance] for more information.

== Receiving Security Advisories

The best way to receive any and all security announcements is to subscribe to the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-security[Akka security list].

NOTE: The mailing list is very low traffic, and receives notifications only after security reports have been managed by the core team and fixes are publicly available.


== Reporting Vulnerabilities

We strongly encourage people to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Following best-practice, we strongly encourage anyone to report potential security vulnerabilities to `security@akka.io` before disclosing them in a public forum like the mailing list or as a GitHub issue.

Reports to this email address will be handled by our security team, who will work together with you to ensure that a fix can be provided without delay.
