= Getting Started

Start with a guided tutorial or explore working samples. The resources below help you learn by building services and agents with Akka.

== Tutorials

These hands-on tutorials walk you step by step through building real Akka systems, from your first minimal agentic service to fully featured applications like shopping carts and AI agents. Each tutorial includes guided instructions, runnable code, and explanations of key concepts.

=== Build your first service

=== Build a multi-agent system

Add agents and other components step-by-step. The final application will consist of dynamic orchestration of multiple agents. A workflow manages the user query process, handling the sequential steps of agent selection, plan creation, execution, and summarization.
