You've built and tried the service locally, it's time to run it on the Akka Agentic Platform without having to change any code.

. If you have not already done so, xref:operations:cli/installation.adoc[install the Akka CLI].

. Authenticate the CLI with your Akka account:
+
[source, command line]
----
akka auth login
----

. Build a container image of your service:
+
[source, command line]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

. Take note of the container name and tag from the last line in the output, for example:
+
[source, command line]
----
DOCKER> Tagging image helloworld-agent:1.0-SNAPSHOT-20250630102843 successful!
----

. Deploy your service, replacing:
* `container-name` with the container name from the `mvn install` output in the previous step
* `tag-name` with the tag name from the `mvn install` output in the previous step

+
[source, command line]
----
akka service deploy helloworld-service helloworld-agent:tag-name --push
----
Your service named `helloworld-service` will now begin deploying.

. Verify the deployment status of your service:
+
[source, command line]
----
akka service list
----
+
A service status can be one of the following:

* *Ready*: All service instances are up-to-date and fully available.
* *UpdateInProgress*: Service is updating.
* *Unavailable*: No service instances are available.
* *PartiallyReady*: Some, but not all, service instances are available.
Approximately one minute after deploying, your service status should become *Ready*.

. Expose your service to the internet:
+
[source, command line]
----
akka service expose helloworld-service
----
+
Should respond with something similar to (the exact address will be unique to your service):
+
[source, command line]
----
Service 'helloworld-service' was successfully exposed at: spring-tooth-3406.gcp-us-east1.akka.services
----

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your service. You can now access it using the hostname described in the output of the command above.

== Invoke your deployed service

You can use https://curl.se[cURL, window="new"] to invoke your service, replacing URL with the hostname from the previous step.

Make an HTTP request to the service:

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XPOST --location "https://spring-tooth-3406.gcp-us-east1.akka.services[http://localhost:9000]/hello" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"user": "alice", "text": "Hello, I am Alice"}'
----

== Explore the console

1. Open the https://console.akka.io[*Akka Console*, window="new"].
2. Navigate to the *Project* where the Service is deployed.
3. Click on the *Service* card of the Service. It shows detailed information about the running service.
