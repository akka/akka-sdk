= List by user

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$new-to-akka-start-here.adoc[]

== Overview

We can retrieve the result of an individual user query directly from the workflow, using the session id that corresponds to the workflow id. It would be nice to list the historical result by user id.

In this part of the guide you will:

* Add a view to be able to query all activity suggestions for a user
* Add a method in the endpoint to use the view

== Prerequisites

include::ROOT:partial$local-dev-prerequisites.adoc[]
* https://platform.openai.com/api-keys[OpenAI API key, window="new"]

== Add a view

Add a new file `ActivityView.java` to `src/main/java/com/example/application/`

[source,java]
.ActivityView.java
----
include::java:example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/agent_guide/part5/ActivityView.java[tag=all]
----
<1> The query selects all rows for a given user id.
<2> The view is updated from the state changes of the workflow.

== Expose in the endpoint

Add a new method that asks the view for a given user id.

[source,java]
----
include::java:example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/agent_guide/part5/ActivityEndpoint.java[tag=list]
----

== Running the service

Start your service locally:

[source,command line]
----
mvn compile exec:java
----

Ask for activities.

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XPOST --location "http://localhost:9000/activities/alice" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"message": "I am in Madrid. What should I do? Beware of the weather."}'
----

Retrieve the suggested activities with the new list method:

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XGET --location "http://localhost:9000/activities/alice"
----

Make another request for activities:

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XPOST --location "http://localhost:9000/activities/alice" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"message": "I am in Stockholm. What should I do? Take the weather into account."}'
----

The list should include suggested activities for both Madrid and Stockholm:

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XGET --location "http://localhost:9000/activities/alice"
----

If you have `jq` installed you can format the json response with:

[source, command line]
----
curl http://localhost:9000/activities/alice | jq
----

== Next steps

* In a larger system with more agents, we could benefit from letting the AI model come up with a plan of which agents to use and in which order to execute. Continue with xref:planner-agent/dynamic-team.adoc[]
