= Weather agent

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$new-to-akka-start-here.adoc[]

== Overview

Activities may depend on the weather, so let's add an agent that retrieves a weather forecast.

In this part of the guide you will:

* Create an agent for the weather forecast that uses an external service as a function tool

== Prerequisites

include::ROOT:partial$local-dev-prerequisites.adoc[]
* https://platform.openai.com/api-keys[OpenAI API key, window="new"]

== Add the agent

Add a new file `WeatherAgent.java` to `src/main/java/com/example/application/`

[source,java]
.WeatherAgent.java
----
include::java:example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/agent_guide/part3/WeatherAgent.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Instructions for the weather agent.
<2> Inject the `HttpClientProvider`.
<3> Provide the weather forecast as a function tool.

Methods annotated with `@FunctionTool` in the agent will automatically be made available to the AI model, which will extract the location from the original query and request to execute the tool to retrieve the forecast.

If you don't want to use the real weather service, you can change the implementation to return a hard-coded weather, such as `"It's always sunny"`.

We could make a request to the `WeatherAgent` from the endpoint before calling the `ActivityAgent` but a better approach is to introduce a workflow that orchestrates the calls between the agents.

== Test the agent

Before introducing the workflow we would like to see that the `WeatherAgent` works in isolation.

To use the preferences from the `ActivityAgent` we need to inject the component client and retrieve the preferences for a given user id.

[source,java]
.ActivityAgent.java
----
include::java:example$doc-snippets/src/test/java/agent_guide/part3/WeatherAgentIntegrationTest.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Extend `TestKitSupport`.
<2> Use the component client to call the agent.
<3> Not much we can assert, since the weather is different every day, but at least we can see the result and that it doesn't fail.

You can sign up for a free API for the weather service at link:https://www.weatherapi.com[window="new"] and then expose it as an environment variable:

[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command window]
----
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command window]
----
set WEATHER_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
----
--

Run the test with

[source,command line]
----
mvn verify
----
