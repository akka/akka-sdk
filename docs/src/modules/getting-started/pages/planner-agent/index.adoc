This guide starts with creating an agent that suggests real-world activities. We will incorporate more components in separate parts of the guide, and at the end we will have a multi-agent system with dynamic planning and orchestration capabilities.

* xref:planner-agent/preferences.adoc[Part 2: User preferences] — An Entity to make the activity suggestions more personalized.
* xref:planner-agent/weather.adoc[Part 3: Weather agent] — An Agent for the weather forecast that uses an external service as a function tool.
* xref:planner-agent/team.adoc[Part 4: Orchestrate the agents] — A Workflow that orchestrates the calls to the agents.
* xref:planner-agent/list.adoc[Part 5: List by user] — A View lists all activity suggestions for a user.
