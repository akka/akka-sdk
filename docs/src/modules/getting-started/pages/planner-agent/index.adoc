include::ROOT:partial$new-to-akka-start-here.adoc[]

This guide starts with creating an agent that suggests real-world activities. We will incorporate more components in separate parts of the guide, and at the end we will have a multi-agent system with dynamic planning and orchestration capabilities.

. xref:planner-agent/activity.adoc[] — An Agent that suggests real-world activities using an LLM.
. xref:planner-agent/preferences.adoc[] — An Entity to make the activity suggestions more personalized.
. xref:planner-agent/weather.adoc[] — An Agent for the weather forecast that uses an external service as a function tool.
. xref:planner-agent/team.adoc[] — A Workflow that orchestrates the calls to the agents.
. xref:planner-agent/list.adoc[] — A View lists all activity suggestions for a user.
. xref:planner-agent/dynamic-team.adoc[] — An Agent that creates a dynamic plan using an LLM, and a Workflow that executes the plan.
. xref:planner-agent/dynamic-team.adoc[] — A Consumer triggers an Agent when the user preferences are changed.
