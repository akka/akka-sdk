= Build an AI multi-agent planner

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$new-to-akka-start-here.adoc[]

This guide starts with creating an agent that suggests real-world activities. We will incorporate more components in separate parts of the guide, and at the end we will have a multi-agent system with dynamic planning and orchestration capabilities.

. xref:planner-agent/activity.adoc[] — An Agent (with session memory) that suggests real-world activities using an LLM.
. xref:planner-agent/preferences.adoc[] — An Entity (long-term memory) to personalize the suggestions.
. xref:planner-agent/weather.adoc[] — A weather forecasting Agent that uses an external service as an agent tool.
. xref:planner-agent/team.adoc[] — A Workflow that coordinates long-running calls across the agents.
. xref:planner-agent/list.adoc[] — A View that creates a read-only projection (i.e. a query) of all activity suggestions for a user.
. xref:planner-agent/dynamic-team.adoc[] — An Agent that creates a dynamic plan using an LLM, and a Workflow that executes the plan.
. xref:planner-agent/eval.adoc[] — A Consumer that streams user preference changes to trigger an Agent.
