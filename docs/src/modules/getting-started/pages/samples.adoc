Samples are available that demonstrate important patterns and abstractions. These can be cloned from their respective repositories. Please refer to the `README` file in each repository for setup and usage instructions.

== Multi-agent AI activity suggestion system

This sample demonstrates how to build a multi-agent system using Akka and an LLM model. A workflow manages the user query process, handling the sequential steps of agent selection, plan creation, execution, and summarization.

== RAG workflow AI agent

This sample illustrates how to create embeddings for vector databases, how to consume LLMs and maintain conversation history, use RAG to add knowledge to fixed LLMs, and expose it all as a streaming service. It uses MongoDB Atlas and OpenAI.

== Medical discharge summarizing agent
This sample illustrate the use of LLMs and prompts to summarize activities. It assigns tags to the medical discharge summaries, while also enabling human verification and comparative analysis. Interactions are from a workflow with an agent using the OpenAI API with configurable model choice.

[%hardbreaks]
**Concepts**: _Agent_, _Summarization_, _Workflow_, _Entity_, _OpenAI_, _Human in the loop_
**Level**: _Intermediate_

== IoT sensor monitoring agent
This sample is a temperature monitoring system that collects, aggregates, and analyzes temperature data from IoT sensors. The system uses AI to generate insights about temperature trends and anomalies across different locations. Collects and aggregates temperature data using Key Value Entities. OpenAI is used for anomaly and trend detection.

== Release note summary generation agent
This sample is designed to run every time there is a release from configured GitHub repositories. It interacts with Anthropic Claude from an agent and uses tools to retrieve detailed information from GitHub. Entities are used for storing release summaries. A timed action looks for new releases periodically and creates the summary using the LLM.

== Agentic customer service workflow
The real-estate customer service agent demonstrates how to combine Akka features with an LLM model. It illustrates an agentic workflow for customer service. It processes incoming real-estate inquiries, analyzes the content to extract details, provides follow-up when needed and saves the collected information for future reference.
