It is also possible to deploy a pre-built sample project in https://console.akka.io[the Akka console, window="new"], eliminating the need for local development.

== Maven archetype

To create the build structure of a new service you can use the Maven archetype. From a command window, in the parent directory of the new service, run the following:

[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command window, subs="attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.akka \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=akka-javasdk-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion={akka-javasdk-version}
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command window, subs="attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate ^
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.akka ^
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=akka-javasdk-archetype ^
  -DarchetypeVersion={akka-javasdk-version}
----
--

The xref:getting-started:author-your-first-service.adoc[] starts from the Maven archetype and lets you implement a very simple agentic service.
