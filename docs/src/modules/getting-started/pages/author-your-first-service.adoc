= Author your first agentic service
:page-aliases: java:build-your-first-application.adoc, java:author-your-first-service.adoc

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

== Introduction 

include::ROOT:partial$concepts-intro.adoc[]

In this guide, you will:

* Set up your development environment.
* Clone a simple project that follows the recommended xref:concepts:architecture-model.adoc#_architecture[onion architecture].
* Explore a basic AI Agent that acts as a creative greeter.
* Explore a basic HTTP Endpoint to interact with the agent.
* Add a request body to the Endpoint.
* Run your service locally.
* Explore the local console to observe your running service.

== Prerequisites

include::ROOT:partial$local-dev-prerequisites.adoc[]
* Git
* https://platform.openai.com/api-keys[OpenAI API key, window="new"]

Akka has support for many AI providers, and this sample is using OpenAI.

You can run this sample without an OpenAI API key, but it will be more fun if you have one. Sign up for free at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys[platform.openai.com/api-keys, window="new"]. If you don't provide an API key, it will use a predefined response instead of using AI.

[#clone_sample]
== Clone the sample project

. From a command line, clone the link:https://github.com/akka-samples/helloworld-agent[Github Repository, window="new"] in a convenient location:
+
[source, command line]
----
git clone https://github.com/akka-samples/helloworld-agent.git
----

. Navigate to the new project directory.

. Open it in your preferred IDE / Editor.

== Explore the Agent

An _Agent_ interacts with an AI model and maintains contextual history in a session memory.

. Open the `src/main/java/com/example/application/HelloWorldAgent.java` file.

The _Agent_ is implemented with:

[source,java]
.HelloWorldAgent.java
----
include::java:example$helloworld-agent/src/main/java/com/example/application/HelloWorldAgent.java[tag=class]
----

The system message provides system-level instructions to the AI model that defines its behavior and context. The system message acts as a foundational prompt that establishes the AI's role, constraints, and operational parameters. It is processed before user messages and helps maintain consistent behavior throughout the interactions.

The user message represents the specific query, instruction, or input that will be processed by the model to generate a response.

== Explore the HTTP Endpoint

An _Endpoint_ is a component that creates an externally accessible API. Endpoints are how you expose your services to the outside world. Endpoints can have different protocols, such as HTTP and gRPC.

HTTP Endpoint components make it possible to conveniently define such APIs accepting and responding in JSON, or dropping down to lower level APIs for ultimate flexibility in what types of data is accepted and returned.

. Open the `src/main/java/com/example/api/HelloWorldEndpoint.java` file.

The _Endpoint_ is implemented with:

[source,java]
.HelloWorldEndpoint.java
----
include::java:example$helloworld-agent/src/main/java/com/example/api/HelloWorldEndpoint.java[tag=class]
----

The `ComponentClient` is the way to call the agent or other components. The agent may participate in a session, which is used for the agent's memory and can also be shared between multiple agents that are collaborating on the same goal.

This Endpoint exposes an HTTP POST operation on `/hello`.

You can also see that there is an _Access Control List_ (ACL) on this Endpoint that allows all traffic from the Internet. Without this ACL the service would be unreachable, but you can be very expressive with these ACLs.

== Run locally

Set your https://platform.openai.com/api-keys[OpenAI API key, window="new"] as an environment variable:

include::ROOT:partial$openai-api-key-env-vars.adoc[]

Start your service locally:

[source,command line]
----
mvn compile exec:java
----

Once successfully started, any defined Endpoints become available at `localhost:9000` and you will see an INFO message that the Akka Runtime has started.

Your "Hello World" service is now running.

In another shell, you can now use `curl` to send requests to this Endpoint.

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XPOST --location "http://localhost:9000/hello" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"user": "alice", "text": "Hello, I am Alice"}'
----

Which will reply with an AI-generated greeting, such as:
[source]
----
Hello, Alice! 😊 It's lovely to meet you! I'm excited to help you with greetings in different languages.
Did you know that language can be like a global passport? Each greeting is a little adventure!

Just for fun, let’s start with a simple greeting. How about "Bonjour" (French)?

In French, you can say "Bonjour" to greet someone during the day. It’s like saying “Good day!”
Isn’t that charming?

Previous greetings: - Hello (English)
----

Try it a few more times with different text messages, for example:

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XPOST --location "http://localhost:9000/hello" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"user": "alice", "text": "I live in New York"}'
----

The AI-generated reply might be:
[source]
----
¡Hola! (Spanish) 🌟 That's fantastic, Alice! New York is such a vibrant city with a plethora of
cultures and languages! You’re living in a melting pot of experiences.

In Spanish, "¡Hola!" is a friendly way to say "Hello!" You could greet someone with this while
enjoying a delicious taco or exploring Central Park!

Previous greetings:
- Hello (English)
- Bonjour (French)
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
What just happened?

The greetings will be in different languages each time. The AI model itself is stateless, so it wouldn't know what languages it had used previously unless we included that information in each request to the model. Akka Agents automatically track context using *session memory*. In this case, the Agent is able to remember all the past messages and languages that were used in this session.

Here we use the user "alice" as the session identifier. Give it a try to change the user field in the HTTP request, and you will see that it starts over without previous knowledge about Alice or the used languages.
====

== Change the agent prompt

In this section, you will modify the instructions for the agent and see how it changes behavior. Open the `HelloWorldAgent.java` file and edit the `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`. For example, you can add the following to the guidelines:

[source,java]
.HelloWorldAgent.java
----
- Include some interesting facts
----

Restart the service and use curl again:

[source, command line]
----
curl -i -XPOST --location "http://localhost:9000/hello" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"user": "blackbeard", "text": "Ahoy there, matey! My name is Blackbeard"}'
----

Does it recognize the pirate greeting and include some facts about Blackbeard?

Something like:

[source]
----
Hello, Blackbeard! (English)

What a fantastic name you have! It’s not every day I get to chat with a legendary pirate.
So tell me, do you sail the high seas or do you prefer to dock at the local coffee shop
for a pirate-themed chai latte?

Previous greetings:
1. Hello (English)

Did you know that the famous pirate Blackbeard has a fascinating history? He was known for
his fearsome appearance, often lighting slow-burning fuses in his beard during battles to
create an intimidating aura! Arrr!

== Explore the local console

The Akka local console is a web-based tool that provides a convenient way to view and interact with your running service.

=== Install the Akka CLI

Starting the local console requires using the Akka CLI and Docker.

include::ROOT:partial$cli-install-short.adoc[]


=== Start the local console

. Start the local console. It will launch a Docker container:
+
[source,bash]
----
akka local console

Pulling local console image, please wait...
----

. Once the console is running, you will see a message like this:

+
[source,bash]
----
- helloworld is running at: localhost:9000
-----------------------------------------------------
(use Ctrl+C to quit)
----

. You can then access the local console in your browser at:
+
http://localhost:3000[window="new"]

. Navigate to your service's Endpoint, which will be available http://localhost:3000/services/helloworld-agent/components/com.example.api.HelloWorldEndpoint[here, window="new"].

ifdef::todo[TODO: Update Console image and include agent, and maybe the SessionMemoryEntity?]

This is a simple Hello World service, so there isn't much to see here yet. However, as you build more complex services, the console will become a more valuable tool for monitoring and debugging.

== Next steps

Now that you have a basic service running, it's time to learn more about building real services in Akka. See xref:getting-started:build-and-deploy-shopping-cart.adoc[] to build a more realistic application and learn how to deploy it to https://console.akka.io[akka.io].
