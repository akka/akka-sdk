= Handling failures

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

The `onFailure` method in the agent's effect API provides comprehensive error handling capabilities for various types of failures that can occur during model processing. This allows you to implement robust fallback strategies and provide meaningful responses even when things go wrong.

== Types of exceptions handled

The `onFailure` method can handle the following types of exceptions:

* **Model-related exceptions:**
  ** `ModelException` - General model processing failures
  ** `RateLimitException` - API rate limiting exceeded
  ** `ModelTimeoutException` - Model request timeout
  ** `UnsupportedFeatureException` - Unsupported model features
  ** `InternalServerException` - Internal service errors

* **Tool execution exceptions:**
  ** `ToolCallExecutionException` - Function tool execution errors
  ** `McpToolCallExecutionException` - MCP tool execution errors
  ** `ToolCallLimitReachedException` - Tool call limit exceeded

* **Response processing exceptions:**
  ** `JsonParsingException` - Response parsing failures (as shown in structured responses)

* **Unknown exceptions:**
  ** `RuntimeException` - For any unexpected errors that don't fall into the above categories

Apart from the listed specific exceptions, users can still encounter `RuntimeException` instances that wrap unexpected errors. Therefore, when handling errors in the `onFailure` method, it's recommended to always include a `default` case to handle any unknown exception types gracefully.

== Implementing fallback strategies

You can use the `onFailure` method to implement different recovery strategies based on the type of exception:

----
<1> Use pattern matching to handle different exception types appropriately.
<2> Handle specific known exceptions with meaningful fallback responses.
<3> For unknown or unexpected exceptions, define a default matching branch providing a generic fallback response.

This approach ensures your agents remain resilient and can provide meaningful responses even when encountering various types of failures during model interaction.
