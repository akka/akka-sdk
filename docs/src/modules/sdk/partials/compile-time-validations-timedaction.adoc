== Compile-time validations

The Akka Java SDK validates TimedAction components at compile time to catch configuration errors early.

=== TimedAction-specific validations

In addition to the xref:compile-time-validations-common.adoc[common validations], TimedActions have the following specific requirements:

==== No @FunctionTool allowed

TimedAction methods cannot be annotated with `@FunctionTool`. TimedActions are designed to be triggered by timers, not called as tools by AI agents. This includes both public and private methods.

==== Command handler arity

Command handler methods (methods returning `TimedAction.Effect`) must have zero or one parameter.

=== TimedAction design patterns

TimedActions are designed for scheduled and delayed operations:

* **Timer-based execution**: Triggered by timers, not direct invocations
* **No tool exposure**: Cannot be called as tools by AI agents
* **Async patterns**: Often used for scheduled cleanup, batch processing, or delayed notifications

Common use cases:

* Scheduled cleanup tasks
* Periodic batch processing
* Delayed notifications
* Timeout handlers
* Recurring maintenance tasks

=== Why these validations matter

These validations ensure:

* **Proper component usage**: TimedActions are for scheduled execution, not interactive tools
* **Clear separation of concerns**: Prevents confusion between scheduled tasks and callable operations
* **Simple action design**: Limited parameters encourage focused, single-purpose actions
