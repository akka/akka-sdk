== Compile-time validations

The Akka Java SDK validates Agent components at compile time to catch configuration errors early.

include::compile-time-validations-common.adoc[tag=intro]

=== Agent-specific validations

In addition to the xref:compile-time-validations-common.adoc[common validations], Agents have the following specific requirements:

==== Single command handler

An Agent must have exactly one public method returning either `Agent.Effect` or `Agent.StreamEffect`. This is the main entry point for the agent.

==== Agent metadata

Use `@Component` (with `name` and `description` parameters) and `@AgentRole` to specify agent metadata:

* `@Component.name` - the display name of the agent
* `@Component.description` - a description of what the agent does
* `@AgentRole` - the role of the agent (e.g., "assistant", "helper")

==== @FunctionTool restrictions for agents

Unlike other components, Agents have special rules for `@FunctionTool`:

* Command handlers (methods returning `Agent.Effect` or `Agent.StreamEffect`) cannot be annotated with `@FunctionTool`
* Helper methods can be annotated with `@FunctionTool` to expose them as tools for the agent
* Private methods _can_ be annotated with `@FunctionTool` (this is unique to Agents)

==== Command handler arity

Agent command handlers follow the common rule: they must have zero or one parameter.

=== Why these validations matter

These validations ensure:

* **Clear agent interface**: A single entry point makes the agent's purpose unambiguous
* **Proper tool definition**: Only helper methods can be tools, not the main command handler
* **Consistent metadata**: Agent descriptions come from one source, preventing conflicts
* **Simplified implementation**: Catching these issues at compile time saves debugging time
