== Compile-time validations

The Akka Java SDK uses annotation processors to validate your component configuration at compile time. This catches common errors early in the development cycle, before you even run your application.

=== Common validations

The following validations apply to all component types:

==== Component must be public

Components must be declared with the `public` modifier.

==== Valid component ID

Every component must have a unique identifier specified via the `@Component` annotation's `id` parameter.

The component ID must:

* Not be empty or blank
* Not contain the pipe character `|`

==== At least one effect method

Each component must have at least one public method returning the appropriate Effect type for that component (e.g., `KeyValueEntity.Effect`, `Workflow.Effect`, etc.).

==== Command handler arity

Command handler methods (public methods returning an Effect type) can only accept zero or one parameter. If you need to pass multiple arguments, wrap them in a class.

==== @FunctionTool restrictions

The `@FunctionTool` annotation is used to expose methods as tools for AI agents. However, it has specific restrictions:

* Cannot be used on private methods (except in Agent components where tools can be private)
* Can only be used on specific method types depending on the component (see component-specific validations)

=== Validation system architecture

The compile-time validation system consists of:

* **ComponentValidationProcessor**: A Java annotation processor that runs during compilation
* **Component-specific validation classes**: Each component type has its own validation logic

When you compile your code, the annotation processor:

1. Discovers all classes annotated with `@Component`
2. Runs component-specific validations
3. Reports any errors through the Java compiler
4. Fails the build if validation errors are found

This ensures that configuration errors are caught immediately during development, rather than at runtime or deployment time.
