= Build Agentic AI Systems with Akka

Akka is a platform for designing, building, operating and continuously reasoning about AI systems composed of autonomous, stateful agents that embrace uncertainty and randomness by design.

== ðŸ’¡ Understand the Akka agentic model

Key concepts and the vision behind the Agentic AI Platform.

* *What is Agentic AI?*  
  Agents making decisions from distributed state and LLM output.

* *The Akka advantage:*  
  Most platforms lack memory models, reasoning observability, or evaluation tools.

* *DevEx: from vibe to power:*  
  Start with a prompt, evolve with AI assistance, or build in code.

* *The Akka component model:*  
  Components for building, operating, and evaluating intelligent, adaptive systems where uncertainty is a first-class concern.

* *OpsEx and EvalOps:*  
  Tools for resilience, observability, and debugging across the system.
