= Welcome to Akka

Akka is a platform as a service (PaaS) to build and run distributed applications that are guaranteed to remain responsive to change. It abstracts the complexities of building distributed systems by providing an event-driven, stateful service model, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than managing infrastructure and scalability.
