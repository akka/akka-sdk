= Welcome to Akka

Akka is a platform for building, running and evaluating agentic systems. It includes a framework, runtime, streaming engine, and memory store for creating any kind of agentic system: AI, autonomous, real-time, adaptive, transactional, analytical, or edge. The Akka Runtime is the most widely adopted actor-based runtime in the world, enabling high-throughput, stateful services that are resilient, elastic and responsive. Akka runs on any infrastructure: public cloud, private cloud or on-premises.
