In Akka, the behavior of your services is decoupled from the execution. This decoupling allows Akka to determine how a service is executed without being constrained by how your system’s behavior is defined. Delegation removes you from worrying about distributed systems, persistence, elasticity, or networking. With Akka’s hosted services, we use delegation to enable swapping out new, improved runtimes while your services are running without a recompilation or redeployment!

In Akka, you specify _what_ the system should do, while the Akka runtime decides _how_ it should be executed. For example, you define an agent by specifying the model it uses, its session memory, and the user prompt. This represents the _what_. The Akka runtime then determines the _how_ by managing processes, virtual threads, persistence, and actor-based concurrency.
