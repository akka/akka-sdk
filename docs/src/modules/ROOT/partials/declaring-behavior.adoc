Your services define the _what_ using `Effects`, which are Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided by each Akka component. When you write a component method, you return an `Effect<...>` object that describes, in a declarative way, what you want Akka to do. 

For example, when using Akka's xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component, you might return an `Effect` that tells the runtime to execute the agent with a system message, a user message, and then send the AI model’s response back to the requester:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
  public Effect<String> query(String question) {
    return effects()
      .systemMessage("You are a helpful...")
      .userMessage(question)
      .thenReply();
  }
