== Synchronous vs asynchronous component invocation

You decide how the xref:reference:glossary.adoc#component_client[component client] invokes the component, and the Akka runtime handles the request in the background. The table below summarizes the key differences between the two approaches.

|Synchronous
|Asynchronous

|When the component method returns
|After the method finishes
|Immediately

|Client behavior
|Waits for the result before continuing
|Continues immediately, must handle the result later

|Return type
|Whatever the component method returns directly
|A `CompletionStage<T>` representing the result at a later time

|Component execution
|Always runs in the background
|Always runs in the background

|Common use case
|Calling a method and using the result in the next line of code
|Starting multiple async tasks or implementing background, always-on processes (Ambient AI)

|Ideal for
|Simple flows where the result is needed immediately
|Parallel task execution, deferred response handling, or long-running background logic
