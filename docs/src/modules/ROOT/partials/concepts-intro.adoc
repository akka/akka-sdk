Akka is a framework, runtime, and memory store for autonomous, adaptive agentic systems. Akka is delivered as an SDK and platform that can execute on any infrastructure, anywhere.

Developers create services built with Akka components that - when deployed - become agentic systems. Services can be tested locally or within a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practice using a Testkit that is available with each Akka component. Your services are compiled into a binary that includes the Akka Runtime which enables your services to self-cluster for scale and resilience. Akka clusters are able to execute on any infrastructure whether bare metal, Kubernetes, Docker or edge. Optionally, add Akka Automated Operations to gain multi-region failover, auto-elasticity, persistence oversight, multi-tenant services, and certificate rotation. Akka Automated Operations has two deployment options: our serverless cloud or your virtual private cloud (VPC).

|Product |Where To Start

|Akka Orchestration
|Akka provides a durable execution engine which automatically captures state at every step, and in the event of failure, can pick up exactly where they left off. No lost progress, no orphaned processes, and no manual recovery required.

You implement orchestration by creating an Akka service with the xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflow] component.

|Akka Agents
|Akka provides a development framework and runtime for agents. Agents can be stateful (durable memory included) or stateless. Agents can be invoked by other Akka components or run autonomously. Agents can transact with embedded tools, MCP servers, or any 3rd party data source with 100s of Akka connectors.

You implement an agent by creating an Akka service with the xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component.

You implement a tool in a regular Java class or embedded within the xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component.

You implement an MCP server with the xref:java:mcp-endpoints.adoc[MCP Endpoint] component.

You implement APIs that can front an agent with the xref:java:http-endpoints.adoc[HTTP Endpoint] and xref:java:grpc-endpoints.adoc[gRPC Endpoint] components.

|Akka Memory
|Akka provides an in-memory, durable store for stateful data. Stateful data can be scoped to a single agent, or made available system-wide. Stateful data is persisted in an embedded event store that tracks incremental state changes, which enables recovery of system state (resilience) to its last known modification. State is automatically sharded and rebalanced across Akka nodes running in a cluster to support elastic scaling to terabytes of memory. State can also be replicated across regions for failover and disaster recovery.

Short-term (traced and episodic) memory is included transparently within the xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component.

You implement long-term memory with the xref:java:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entity] and xref:java:key-value-entities.adoc[Key Value Entity] components.

You implement propagations of cross-system state with the xref:java:views.adoc[View] component. Views implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.

|Akka Streaming
|Akka provides a continuous stream processing engine which can synthesize, aggregate, and analyze windows of data without receiving a terminating event. Data streams can be sourced from other Akka services or a 3rd party messaging broker or coming in through an Akka Endpoint. Your services can either store intermediate processing results into _Akka Memory_ or trigger commands to other Akka components that take action on the data.

You produce events to a message broker with the xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc#_event_producer[Producer] annotation.

You create a continuous incoming stream of events with the xref:java:http-endpoints.adoc[HTTP Endpoint] or the xref:java:grpc-endpoints.adoc[gRPC Endpoint] components.

You create a stream processor to analyze and act against a stream of data with the xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consumer] component.

== Composability

The services you build with Akka components are composable, which can be combined to design agentic, transactional, analytics, edge, and digital twin systems. You can create services with one component or many. Let Akka unlock your distributed systems artistry!
