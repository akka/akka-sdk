Akka is a framework, runtime, and memory store for autonomous, adaptive agentic systems. Akka is delivered as an SDK and platform that can execute on any infrastructure, anywhere.

image:concepts:akka-agentic-platform.png[Akka Agentic Platform]

Developers create services built with _Akka components_ that - when deployed - become agentic systems. Services can be tested locally or within a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practice using a _Testkit_ that is available with each Akka component. Your services are compiled into a binary that includes the _Akka Runtime_ which enables your services to self-cluster for scale and resilience. _Akka clusters_ are able to execute on any infrastructure whether bare metal, Kubernetes, Docker or edge. Optionally, add _Akka Automated Operations_ to gain multi-region failover, auto-elasticity, persistence oversight, multi-tenant services, and certificate rotation. _Akka Automated Operations_ has two deployment options: our serverless cloud or your virtual private cloud (VPC).

|Product |Where To Start

|Akka Orchestration
|Akka provides a durable execution engine which automatically captures state at every step, and in the event of failure, can pick up exactly where they left off. No lost progress, no orphaned processes, and no manual recovery required.

You implement orchestration by creating an Akka service with the xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflow] component.

|Akka Agents
|Akka provides a development framework and runtime for agents. Agents can be stateful (durable memory included) or stateless. Agents can be invoked by other Akka components or run autonomously. Agents can transact with embedded tools, MCP servers, or any 3rd party data source with 100s of Akka connectors.

You implement an agent by creating an Akka service with the xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component.

You implement a tool in a regular Java class or embedded within the xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component.

You implement an MCP server with the xref:java:mcp-endpoints.adoc[MCP Endpoint] component.

You implement APIs that can front an agent with the xref:java:http-endpoints.adoc[HTTP Endpoint] and xref:java:grpc-endpoints.adoc[gRPC Endpoint] components.

|Akka Memory
|Akka provides an in-memory, durable store for stateful data. Stateful data can be scoped to a single agent, or made available system-wide. Stateful data is persisted in an embedded event store that tracks incremental state changes, which enables recovery of system state (resilience) to its last known modification. State is automatically sharded and rebalanced across Akka nodes running in a cluster to support elastic scaling to terabytes of memory. State can also be replicated across regions for failover and disaster recovery.

Short-term (traced and episodic) memory is included transparently within the xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component.

You implement long-term memory with the xref:java:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entity] and xref:java:key-value-entities.adoc[Key Value Entity] components.

You implement propagations of cross-system state with the xref:java:views.adoc[View] component. Views implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.

|Akka Streaming
|Akka provides a continuous stream processing engine which can synthesize, aggregate, and analyze windows of data without receiving a terminating event. Data streams can be sourced from other Akka services or a 3rd party messaging broker or coming in through an Akka Endpoint. Your services can either store intermediate processing results into _Akka Memory_ or trigger commands to other Akka components that take action on the data.

You produce events to a message broker with the xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc#_event_producer[Producer] annotation.

You create a continuous incoming stream of events with the xref:java:http-endpoints.adoc[HTTP Endpoint] or the xref:java:grpc-endpoints.adoc[gRPC Endpoint] components.

You create a stream processor to analyze and act against a stream of data with the xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consumer] component.

== Components

You build your application using xref:reference:glossary.adoc#component[Akka _Components_]. These components provide structure and help maintain responsiveness. Below is a brief overview of each.

With the exception of endpoints, Akka components are placed in your `application` package. Endpoints live in the `api` package. Components are identified to the runtime with either a `@ComponentId` or `@HttpEndpoint` annotation.

=== Agents

image:ROOT:agent.png[Agent,width=100,float=left]An _Agent_ interacts with an AI model to perform a specific task. It is typically backed by a large language model (LLM). It maintains contextual history in a session memory, which may be shared between multiple agents that are collaborating on the same goal. It may provide function tools and call them as requested by the model. For more information see xref:java:agents.adoc[Agents].

=== Endpoints

image:ROOT:endpoint.png[Endpoints,width=100,float=left] _Endpoints_ are defined points of interaction for services that allow external clients to communicate via HTTP or gRPC. They facilitate the integration and communication between the other types of internal Akka components. Unlike other Akka components, endpoints will live in your `api` package. For more information see xref:java:http-endpoints.adoc[HTTP Endpoints] and xref:java:grpc-endpoints.adoc[gRPC Endpoints].

=== Workflows

image:ROOT:workflow.png[Workflows,width=100,float=left] _Workflows_ enable the developer to implement long-running, multi-step business processes while focusing exclusively on domain and business logic. Technical concerns such as delivery guarantees, scaling, error handling and recovery are managed by Akka. For more information see xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflows].

=== Entities

image:ROOT:entity.png[Entities,width=100,float=left] _Entities_ are the core components of Akka and provide persistence and state management. They map to your https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html[_domain aggregates_, window="new"]. If you have a "Customer" domain aggregate, you almost certainly will have a `CustomerEntity` component to expose and manipulate it. This separation of concerns allows the domain object to remain purely business logic focused while the Entity handles runtime mechanics. Additionally, you may have other domain objects that are leafs of the domain aggregate. These do not need their own entity if they are just a leaf of the aggregate. An address is a good example.

There are two types of entities in Akka. Their difference lies in how they internally function and are persisted.

==== Event Sourced Entities

image:ROOT:event-sourced-entity.png[Event Sourced Entities,width=100,float=left] _Event Sourced Entities_ persist events instead of state in the event xref:reference:glossary.adoc#journal[journal]   . The current state of the entity is derived from these events. Readers can access the event journal independently of the active entity instance to create read models, known as xref:java:views.adoc[_Views_], or to perform business actions based on the events via xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consumers]. For more information, see xref:java:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entities].

==== Key Value Entities

image:ROOT:key-value-entity.png[Key Value Entities,width=100,float=left] _Key Value Entities_ are, as the name implies, an object that is stored and retrieved based on a key - an identifier of some sort. The value is the entire state of the object. Every write to a Key Value Entity persists the entire state of the object. Key Value Entities are similar in some ways to database records. They write and effectively lock the whole row. They still use an underlying event-based architecture so other components can subscribe to the stream of their updates. For more information see xref:java:key-value-entities.adoc[Key Value Entities].

=== Views

image:ROOT:view.png[Views,width=100,float=left] _Views_ provide a way to materialize read-only state from different parts of the system. A view can be defined from Key Value Entity state changes, Event Sourced Entity events, Workflow state transitions, messages from subscribed broker topics, or events received from another Akka service. For more information see xref:java:views.adoc[Views].

=== Timed actions

image:ROOT:timer.png[Timed actions,width=100,float=left] _Timed Actions_ allow for scheduling calls in the future. For example, to verify that some process have been completed or not. For more information see xref:java:timed-actions.adoc[Timed actions].

=== Consumers

image:ROOT:consumer.png[Consumers,width=100,float=left] _Consumers_ listen for and process events or messages from various sources, such as Event Sourced Entities, Key Value Entities and external messaging systems. They can also produce messages to topics, facilitating communication and data flow between different services within an application. For more information see xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consuming and producing].

== Composability

The services you build with Akka components are composable, which can be combined to design agentic, transactional, analytics, edge, and digital twin systems. You can create services with one component or many. Let Akka unlock your distributed systems artistry!
