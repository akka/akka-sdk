= Enable CLI command completion

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Completion allows you to hit [TAB] on a partially entered `akka` command and have the shell complete the command, subcommand or flag for you.

[.tabset]
bash::
To load completion in the current bash shell run:
+
[source,bash]
----
source <(akka completion)
----
+
Configure bash to load `akka` completions for each session by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
# add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile
source <(akka completion)
----
+
[TIP]
====
Using bash completions with `akka` requires you have bash completions enabled to begin with.
Enable it in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file with the following lines:

[source,bash]
----
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
  source /etc/bash_completion
fi
----
For definitive details on setting up your shell with auto-completion, see the shell documentation.
