In this guide, you will learn how to deploy Akka services using the Akka CLI. By the end, you will have deployed a service and learned how to check its status, update it, and remove it if necessary.

== Prerequisites

Before deploying a service, make sure you have:

* https://console.akka.io/register[Registered for an Akka account]
* xref:operations:create-project.adoc[Created an Akka project]
* xref:akka-cli:installation.adoc[Installed the Akka CLI]
* A container image ready for deployment

== Deploying a service

To deploy your service, run the following command, replacing `my-service` with your service name and updating the container URI and tag:

[source, command line]
----
akka service deploy \
    my-service \
    my-container-uri/container-name:tag-name
----

Your service is now deployed.

== How to verify the service status

You can verify whether your service was successfully deployed and check its current status.

Akka Console::

--
1. Open the *Akka Console*.
2. Navigate to the *Dashboard*.
3. Look for the *Services* card, which displays the status of all services in your project.

A service status can be one of the following:

* *Ready*: All service instances are up to date and fully available.
* *UpdateInProgress*: Service is updating.
* *Unavailable*: No service instances are available.
* *PartiallyReady*: Some, but not all, service instances are available.

Akka CLI::

Alternatively, you can verify the service status from the command line with this command:

[source, command line]
----
akka service list
----

A service status can be one of the following:

* *Ready*: All service instances are up to date and fully available.
* *UpdateInProgress*: Service is updating.
* *Unavailable*: No service instances are available.
* *PartiallyReady*: Some, but not all, service instances are available.

== How to update a deployed service

If you need to update your service with a new container image:

1. *Make changes* to your service and *package them* into a *new container image*.
2. *Tag your new image* with an updated version (e.g., `tag-name-2`).
3. *Deploy the updated image* by running:

[source, command line]
----
akka service deploy \
    my-service \
    my-container-uri/container-name:tag-name-2
----

Akka will perform a rolling update, replacing old instances with new ones.

== How to remove a deployed service

To remove a deployed service, run the following command, replacing `my-service` with the service name you want to remove:

[source, command line]
----
akka service delete my-service
----

The service will be deleted, and its resources will be freed.

== Conclusion

You now know how to deploy, verify, update, and remove Akka services using the Akka CLI. Continue experimenting with different configurations and commands to further enhance your services.
