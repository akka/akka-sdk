Akka provides a host of observability and monitoring capabilities and is designed to plug into your existing monitoring tools. This means that while the tools in https://console.akka.io[Akka Console] will allow you to understand what is happening, they are designed to feed other tools you use to monitor, log, and observe your applications and services over time. 

You can view logs, metrics, and traces via the following:

* xref:operations:view-logs.adoc[]
* xref:operations:controltower-metrics.adoc[]
* xref:operations:controltower-traces.adoc[]

To export this data into your other tools see xref:operations:observability-exports.adoc[] for more information.
