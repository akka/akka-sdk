= Configure message brokers
include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Akka eventing integrates with _Google Cloud Pub/Sub_ and managed Kafka services such as _Confluent Cloud_, _Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)_, and _Aiven for Apache Kafka_ to enable asynchronous messaging and integrations with other systems.

Message brokers are configured at the Akka project level. A project can have one broker configuration. Akka eventing is independent of the broker technology.

== Broker services

Follow the detailed steps to configure the desired message broker service for use with your Akka project:

- xref:operations:projects/broker-google-pubsub.adoc[Google Pub/Sub]
- xref:operations:projects/broker-confluent.adoc[Confluent Cloud]
- xref:operations:projects/broker-aws-msk.adoc[Amazon MSK]
- xref:operations:projects/broker-aiven.adoc[Aiven for Apache Kafka]

We continuously evaluate additional integrations for potential built-in support in Akka. If you have specific requirements, please contact us at mailto:support@akka.io[].

For running Akka services that integrate with a message broker locally, see xref:java:running-locally.adoc#_local_broker_support[running a service with broker support].
