:page-supergroup-browser-cli: Interface

Akka provides logs that you can view in the Console or access with the CLI. For each service instance we aggregate a maximum of 1MB of log data. You can capture all log output by attaching a logging provider, such as Google Cloud's operations suite (formerly Stackdriver), as described xref:observability-and-monitoring/observability-exports.adoc#_google_cloud[here].

== Aggregated logs

To view aggregated logs:

[.tabset]
Browser::
+
. From the project *Dashboard*, select a deployed service.
. From the service *Overview* page, select *Logs* from the top tab or from the left navigation menu.
The *Logs* table displays logging output, which you can filter with the control on top.


CLI::
With a command window set to your project, use the `akka logs` command to view the logs for a running service:
+
[source,command line]
----
akka logs <<service-name>>
----

== Exporting logs

Logs can be exported for searching, reporting, alerting and long term storage by configuring the Akka observability configuration for your project. See xref:observability-and-monitoring/observability-exports.adoc[here] for detailed documentation.


== Correlating logs

You can correlate your log statements, those that you write in your application, by adding the MDC pattern `%mdc{trace_id}` to your log file when tracing is xref:operations:observability-and-monitoring/observability-exports.adoc#activating_tracing[enabled]. Like the following:

[source,xml]
.logback.xml
----
<configuration>
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{36} trace_id: %mdc{trace_id} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
...
</configuration>
----

This way, the trace ID that's passed through your components will be added to your logs. For more information on tracing, click xref:operations:observability-and-monitoring/traces.adoc[here].
