include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Akka provides detailed billing information to help organizations monitor and manage the operational costs associated with their projects. Users with the *billing-admin* role can view:

* *Cost breakdown* for each project in the organization.
* *Month-to-date aggregate cost*.
* *Cost forecast* based on current and projected usage across all projects.

Billing data is accessible only to users with the *billing-admin* role. For more information on assigning this role, see the xref:#assigning_billing_admin[] section below.

== Billing Interface

:TODO: Is this still correct in the Console?

For *billing-admin* users, a billing icon appears in the https://console.akka.io/[Akka Console's, window="new"] side navigation. Clicking this icon opens the billing interface, where users can select the billing month and organization to view detailed billing data.

If a user is a billing admin for multiple organizations, they can switch between organizations in the billing UI.

:TODO: update image

In the billing UI:

* *Month-to-date costs* and a *cost forecast* for the current month are displayed in the upper-right corner.
* Billing data for each project within the selected organization is broken down into the following categories:
  ** *Network Data Transfer*: Charges for data transfer across all services, measured in GB.
  ** *Data Operations*: Total read and write operations for all services.
  ** *Instance Hours*: Total hours service instances have been running during the month.
  ** *Data Persistence*: Total amount of data persisted during the month, measured in GB-Hours.
