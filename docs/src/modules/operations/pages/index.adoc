= Operating

Akka offers two distinct operational approaches:

* xref:operations:configuring.adoc[*Self-managed operations*]: For teams that prefer to operate Akka on their own infrastructure. This provides full control over runtime and operational details.

* xref:operations:akka-platform.adoc[*Akka Automated Operations*]: For teams seeking a managed experience with built-in automation, observability, and scalability. Services are deployed either in our serverless cloud or your VPC. AAO gives you a single entry point to all of your Akka regions.
