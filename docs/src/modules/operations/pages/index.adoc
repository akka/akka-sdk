= Operating Akka

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Akka offers two distinct operational models:

* *Akka Platform* – A fully-managed experience with automation, observability, and scalability built-in.
* *Self-managed nodes* – A flexible approach for teams that want full control over infrastructure and operations.

== Akka Platform: Fully-automated operations

Akka Platform provides a Kubernetes-based control and execution plane for deploying and managing Akka services with high elasticity and resilience. It enables full automation, built-in observability, and project-wide operations across regions.

=== Key Capabilities

* xref:platform-features.adoc[] – Overview of the Akka Platform’s operational automation features.
* xref:concepts:deployment-model.adoc[] – Background on Akka's deployment models.

=== Core Operations

Manage deployed services, monitor behavior, and ensure performance through the following components:

* xref:operations:services/index.adoc[] – Overview of Akka services and service management.

** xref:operations:projects/secrets.adoc[]

* xref:operations:regions/index.adoc[] – Multi-region architecture with automatic data replication.

* xref:operations:cli/index.adoc[] – Full access to operations via the Akka CLI.

** xref:operations:cli/using-cli.adoc[]
** xref:operations:cli/command-completion.adoc[]

== Self-managed: Operate Akka Anywhere

For organizations that require full control over deployment and infrastructure, Akka supports self-managed nodes. This model gives you the flexibility to run services in any container environment or infrastructure provider while assuming responsibility for:

* Installation and updates  
* Clustering and networking  
* Secure service-to-service communication  
* Routing and service discovery  
* Persistent storage configuration  

Akka services are shipped as standalone binaries and support seamless migration between self-managed environments and Akka Platform.

=== Self-managed Guidance

* xref:configuring.adoc[] – Instructions for configuring your Akka services in custom environments.

=== Deployment Environments

Akka self-managed nodes can be deployed in:

* Docker Compose
* Kubernetes
* Fly.io
* Render
* Heroku
* Linode
* Cloud virtual machines and bare metal

[NOTE]
====
When using platforms with limited cluster support (e.g., Fly.io, Heroku), configure Akka for single-node operation due to restricted networking.
