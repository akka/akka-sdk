= Operating

Akka offers two distinct operational approaches:

* *Self-managed operations*: For teams that prefer to operate Akka on their own infrastructure. This provides full control over runtime and operational details.

* *Akka Automated Operations*: For teams seeking a managed experience with built-in automation, observability, and scalability. Services are deployed either in our https://console.akka.io[serverless cloud] or your VPC.
