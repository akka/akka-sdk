= Akka libraries

TIP: A glance of all Akka libraries and their current versions is presented at https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-dependencies/current[Akka library versions].

== Learn

=== Try some actors in https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/actors.html#first-example[a first example]
Send some "Hello world!" message between actors, continue with building a chat room.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/guide/introduction.html[Getting started guide]
Learn Akka libraries concepts applied to an example around IoT.

== Architecture
=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/guide/microservices-tutorial/index.html[Microservices]
Tutorial bringing together essential parts of the Akka libraries to build resilient and scalable microservices from scratch.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-distributed-cluster/current/index.html[Distributed Cluster]
Connect Akka services built on Akka libraries across geographical locations for lower latency and higher availability.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-distributed-cluster/current/index.html[Edge]
Move your endpoints to the edge of the cloud for lower latency and higher availability. Akka Edge Rust extends the power of Akkaâ€™s event-driven model to resource-constrained devices.

== Foundations
=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/index.html[Actors]
At the core of Akka: A model for concurrency and distribution without all the pain of threading primitives.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/stream/index.html[Streams]
An intuitive and safe way to do asynchronous, non-blocking backpressured stream processing.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/typed/persistence.html[Event sourcing]
Enables stateful actors to persist their state changes, so that the state can be recovered when an actor is restarted.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/index-persistence-durable-state.html[Durable state]
Enables stateful actors to persist their latest state, so that it can be recovered when an actor is restarted.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-projection/current/[Projections]
Build a projected model out of streams of events.

== Communications and integrations
=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-http/current/introduction.html[HTTP]
Modern, fast, asynchronous, streaming-first HTTP server and client.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-grpc/current/whygrpc.html[gRPC]
Fully typed, streaming gRPC servers and clients.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/alpakka/current/[Integrations]
Streaming integrations to various technologies including https://doc.akka.io/libraries/alpakka-kafka/current/[Apache Kafka]. Codename: https://doc.akka.io/libraries/alpakka/current/[Alpakka]

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-persistence-r2dbc/current/getting-started.html[Akka Persistence R2DBC]

Use Cassandra databases with Akka Persistence.

== Resilience and distribution
=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/cluster.html[Cluster]
Achieve resilience and elasticity by distributing your system over multiple nodes.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html[Cluster Sharding]
Distribute your actors across the cluster based on their identity.

=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-core/current/typed/distributed-data.html[Distributed Data]
Eventually consistent, highly read and write available, low latency data.

== Operating
=== https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-management/current/[Management]
