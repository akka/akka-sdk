.Entity sharding
****
Entities offer strong consistency guarantees. Akka distributes Entities across every instance of a stateful service deployment--at any given time. Each entity has an identity, and for each entity identity, there is only one instance that holds the system of record and processes the requests for that entity. If a command for an Entity arrives to an instance not hosting that Entity, the command is forwarded by the Akka Runtime to the one that hosts that particular Entity. This forwarding is done transparently, your code does not need to know. Because each Entity lives on exactly one instance, messages can be handled sequentially. Hence, there are no concurrency concerns relating to Entities, each Entity handles one message at a time.

The state of the Entity is kept in memory as long as it is active. This means it can serve read requests or command validation before updating without additional reads from the durable storage. There might not be room for all entities to be kept active in memory all the time and therefore least recently used entities can be passivated. When the entity is used again it recovers its state from durable storage and becomes an active Entity with its system of record in memory, backed by consistent durable storage. This recovery process is also used in cases of rolling updates, rebalance, and abnormal crashes.
