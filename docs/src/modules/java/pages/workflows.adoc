= Implementing Workflows

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

image:ROOT:workflow.png[Workflow,width=100,float=left] Workflows implement long-running, multi-step business processes while allowing developers to focus exclusively on domain and business logic. Workflows provide durability, consistency and the ability to call other components and services. Business transactions can be modeled in one central place, and the Workflow will keep them running smoothly, or roll back if something goes wrong.

Users can see the workflow execution details in the console (both xref:running-locally.adoc#_local_console[locally] and in the https://console.akka.io[cloud]).

[#_effect_api]
== Workflow's Effect API

The Workflow's Effect defines the operations that Akka should perform when an incoming command is handled by a Workflow.

A Workflow Effect can either:

* update the state of the workflow
* define the next step to be executed (transition)
* pause the workflow
* end the workflow
* fail the step or reject a command by returning an error
* reply to incoming commands

For additional details, refer to xref:concepts:declarative-effects.adoc[Declarative Effects].

== Skeleton

A Workflow implementation has the following code structure.

[source,java]
.{sample-base-url}/doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/application/TransferWorkflow.java[TransferWorkflow.java]
----
include::example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Annotate the class with `@ComponentId` and pass a unique identifier for this workflow type.
<2> Class that extends `Workflow`.
<3> Define the workflow steps.
<4> Each step has a name.
<5> The step consists of a call, which is a lambda that will be called to execute the step.
<6> When the call has completed successfully the `andThen` lambda is called, and here you can update the state and transition to next step.
<7> The workflow has methods that can be called with the component client.
<8> Those methods return an effect, which can be instructions to update the state and transition to a certain step.

There must be at least one command handler method, which returns `Effect`. It is the command handler methods that can be called with the component client from other components, such as an endpoint. The workflow is started by the first command, which will transition to the initial step.

== Modeling state

We want to build a simple workflow that transfers funds between two wallets. Before that, we will create a wallet subdomain with some basic functionalities that we could use later. A `WalletEntity` is implemented as an xref:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entity], which is a better choice than a Key Value Entity for implementing a wallet, because a ledger of all transactions is usually required by the business.

The `Wallet` class represents domain object that holds the wallet balance. We can also withdraw or deposit funds to the wallet.

Domain events for creating and updating the wallet.

----
include::example$transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/wallet/domain/WalletEvent.java[tag=event]
----

The domain object is wrapped with a Event Sourced Entity component.

.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/wallet/application/WalletEntity.java[WalletEntity.java]

include::example$transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/wallet/application/WalletEntity.java[tag=wallet]
----
<1> Create a wallet with an initial balance.
<2> Withdraw funds from the wallet.
<3> Deposit funds to the wallet.
<4> Get current wallet balance.

Now we can focus on the workflow implementation itself. A workflow has state, which can be updated in command handlers and step implementations. During the state modeling we might consider the information that is required for validation, running the steps, collecting data from steps or tracking the workflow progress.

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/domain/TransferState.java[TransferState.java]
----
include::example$transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/domain/TransferState.java[tag=domain]
----
<1> A `Transfer` record encapsulates data required to withdraw and deposit funds.
<2> A `TransferStatus` is used to track workflow progress.

== Implementing behavior

Now that we have our workflow state defined, the remaining tasks can be summarized as follows:

- declare your workflow and pick a workflow id (it needs to be unique as it will be used for sharding purposes);
- implement handler(s) to interact with the workflow (e.g. to start a workflow, or provide additional data) or retrieve its current state;
- provide a workflow definition with all possible steps and transitions between them.

== Starting workflow

Let's have a look at what our transfer workflow will look like for the first 2 points from the above list. We will now define how to launch a workflow with a `startTransfer` command handler that will return an `Effect` to start a workflow by providing a transition to the first step. Also, we will update the state with an initial value.

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[TransferWorkflow.java]
----
include::example$transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Annotate such class with `@ComponentId` and pass a unique identifier for this workflow type.
<2> Extend `Workflow<S>`, where `S` is the state type this workflow will store (i.e. `TransferState`).
<3> Create a method to start the workflow that returns an `Effect<Done>` class.
<4> The validation ensures the transfer amount is greater than zero and the workflow is not running already. Otherwise, we might corrupt the existing workflow.
<5> From the incoming data we create an initial `TransferState`.
<6> We instruct Akka to persist the new state.
<7> With the `transitionTo` method, we inform that the name of the first step is "withdraw" and the input for this step is a `Withdraw` object.
<8> The last instruction is to inform the caller that the workflow was successfully started.


NOTE: The `@ComponentId` value `transfer` is common for all instances of this workflow but must be stable - cannot be changed after a production deploy - and unique across the different workflow types.

== Workflow definition

One missing piece of our transfer workflow implementation is a workflow `definition` method, which composes all steps connected with transitions. A workflow `Step` has a unique name, an action to perform (e.g. a call to an Akka component, or a call to an external service) and a transition to select the next step (or `end` transition to finish the workflow, in case of the last step).

ifdef::todo[TODO: add some diagram or sth]

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[TransferWorkflow.java]
----
include::example$transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=definition]
----
<1> We collect all steps to form a workflow definition.
<2> Each step should have a unique name.
<3> Using the xref:component-and-service-calls.adoc#_component_client[ComponentClient], which is injected in the constructor.
<4> We instruct Akka to run a given call to withdraw funds from a wallet.
<5> After successful withdrawal we return an `Effect` that will update the workflow state and move to the next step called "deposit." An input parameter for this step is a `Deposit` record.
<6> Another workflow step action to deposit funds to a given wallet.
<7> This time we return an effect that will stop workflow processing, by using the special `end` method.

The step consists of two parts, a lambda that is called to execute the step, and a second lambda that is run when the call has completed successfully. In the `call` lamda you implement what should be executed in the step, and this may be retried until successful. In the `andThen` lambda you can update the state and decide (based on the `call` result) what the next step should be.

The workflow will automatically execute the steps in a reliable and durable way. This means that if a call in a step fails, it will be retried until it succeeds or the retry limit of the recovery strategy is reached and separate error handling can be performed. The state machine of the workflow is durable, which means that if the workflow is restarted for some reason it will continue from where it left off, i.e. execute the current non-completed step again.

It is possible to pass input from `transitionTo` to the call in the next step. It's also possible to pass the result from the call to the `andThen`. These inputs and outputs are optional, and you can use supplier lambdas without parameter, e.g. `call(() -> {})`. The state of the workflow can be accessed with `currentState()` from both the `call` and the `andThen` lambdas, but it can only be updated from `andThen`.

IMPORTANT: In the following example all `WalletEntity` interactions are not idempotent. It means that if the workflow step retries, it will make the deposit or withdraw again. In a real-world scenario, you should consider making all interactions idempotent with a proper deduplication mechanism. A very basic example of handling retries for workflows can be found in https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/transfer-workflow-compensation/src/main/java/com/example/wallet/domain/Wallet.java[this] sample.

== Retrieving state

To have access to the current state of the workflow we can use `currentState()`. However, if this is the first command we are receiving for this workflow, the state will be `null`. We can change it by overriding the `emptyState` method. The following example shows the implementation of the read-only command handler:

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[TransferWorkflow.java]
----
include::example$transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=get-transfer]
----
<1> Return the current state as reply for the request.

IMPORTANT: We are returning the internal state directly back to the requester. In the endpoint, it's usually best to convert this internal domain model into a public model so the internal representation is free to evolve without breaking clients code.

A full transfer workflow source code sample can be downloaded as a link:../java/_attachments/workflow-quickstart.zip[zip file]. Follow the `README` file to run and test it.

== Deleting state

If you want to delete the workflow state, you can use the `effects().delete` method. This will remove the workflow from the system.

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[TransferWorkflow.java]
----
include::example$transfer-workflow/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=delete-workflow]
----
<1> Instruction to delete the workflow.

When you give the instruction to delete a running workflow it's equivalent to ending and deleting a workflow. For already finished workflows, it is possible to delete them in the command handler. The actual removal of workflow state is delayed to give downstream consumers time to process all prior updates. Including the fact that the workflow has been deleted (via method annotated with `@DeleteHandler`). By default, the existence of the workflow is completely cleaned up after a week.

You can still handle read requests to the workflow until it has been completely removed, but the current state will be empty (or null). To check whether the workflow has been deleted, you can use the `isDeleted` method inherited from the `Workflow` class.

It is best to not reuse the same workflow id after deletion, but if that happens after the workflow has been completely removed it will be instantiated as a completely new workflow without any knowledge of previous state.

== Pausing workflow

A long-running workflow can be paused while waiting for some additional information to continue processing. A special `pause` transition can be used to inform Akka that the execution of the Workflow should be postponed. By launching a Workflow command handler, the user can then resume the processing. Additionally, a Timer can be scheduled to automatically inform the Workflow that the expected time for the additional data has passed.

----
<1> Schedules a timer as a Workflow step action. Make sure that the timer name is unique for every Workflow instance.
<2> Pauses the Workflow execution.

NOTE: Remember to cancel the timer once the Workflow is resumed. Also, adjust the workflow xref:#_timeouts[timeout], if it has been defined, to be longer than the longest expected pause. 8 hours in this example.

Exposing additional mutational method from the Workflow implementation should be done with special caution. Accepting a call to such method should only be possible when the Workflow is in the expected state.

----
<1> Accepts the request only when status is `WAITING_FOR_ACCEPTATION`.
<2> Otherwise, rejects the requests.

== Error handling

Design for failure is one of the key attributes of all Akka components. Workflow has the richest set of configurations from all of them. It's essential to build robust and reliable solutions.

=== Timeouts

By default, a workflow run has no time limit. It can run forever, which in most cases is not desirable behavior. A workflow step, on the other hand, has a default timeout of 5 seconds. Both settings can be overridden at the workflow definition level or for a specific step configuration.

----
include::example$transfer-workflow-compensation/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=timeouts]
----
<1> Sets a timeout for the duration of the entire workflow. When the timeout expires, the workflow is finished and no transitions are allowed.
<2> Sets a default timeout for all workflow steps.

A default step timeout can be overridden for an individual step.

----
include::example$transfer-workflow-compensation/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=step-timeout]
----
<1> Overrides the step timeout for a specific step.

=== Recover strategy

It's time to define what should happen in case of timeout or any other unhandled error.

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow-compensation/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[TransferWorkflow.java]
----
include::example$transfer-workflow-compensation/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=recover-strategy]
----
<1> Set a failover transition in case of a workflow timeout.
<2> Set a default failover transition for all steps with maximum number of retries.
<3> Override the step recovery strategy for the `deposit` step.


NOTE: In case of a workflow timeout one last failover step can be performed. Transitions from that failover step will be ignored.

=== Compensation

The idea behind the Workflow error handling is that workflows should only fail due to unknown errors during execution. In general, you should always write your workflows so that they do not fail on any known edge cases. If you expect an error, it's better to be explicit about it, possibly with your domain types. Based on this information and the flexible Workflow API you can define a compensation for any workflow step.

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/transfer-workflow-compensation/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[TransferWorkflow.java]
----
include::example$transfer-workflow-compensation/src/main/java/com/example/transfer/application/TransferWorkflow.java[tag=compensation]
----
<1> Explicit deposit call result type `WalletResult`.
<2> Finish workflow as completed, in the case of a successful deposit.
<3> Launch compensation step to handle deposit failure. The `"withdraw"` step must be reversed.
<4> Compensation step is like any other step, with the same set of functionalities.
<5> Correct compensation can finish the workflow.
<6> Any other result might be handled by a default recovery strategy.

Compensating a workflow step(s) might involve multiple logical steps and thus is part of the overall business logic that must be defined within the workflow itself. For simplicity, in the example above, the compensation is applied only to `withdraw` step. Whereas `deposit` step itself might also require a compensation. In case of a step timeout we can't be certain about step successful or error outcome.

A full error handling and compensation sample can be downloaded as a link:../java/_attachments/workflow-quickstart.zip[zip file]. Run `TransferWorkflowIntegrationTest` and examine the logs from the application.
