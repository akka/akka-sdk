= Build your first application

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your environment, generating a project, and implementing a simple application. By the end, you will have a functional Shopping Cart application built with the Akka SDK.

== Overview

The Akka SDK comes with Maven support that enables you to get started quickly. In this guide, you will:

* Use the Akka Maven archetype to generate a skeleton project that follows the recommended onion architecture.
* Understand how to use the Akka Maven parent POM to define dependencies and run your application locally.

== Prerequisites

include::ROOT:partial$cloud-dev-prerequisites.adoc[]


== Generate and build the skeleton project

The Maven archetype template prompts you to specify the project's group ID, name and version interactively. Run it using the commands shown for your OS.

[sidebar]
In IntelliJ, you can skip the command line. Open the IDE, select
*File > New > Project*, and click to activate *Create from archetype*. Use the UI to locate the archetype and fill in the blanks.

Follow these steps to generate and build your project:

. From a command window, run the template in a convenient location:
+
[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command window, subs="attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.akka \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=akka-javasdk-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion={akka-javasdk-version}
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command window, subs="attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate ^
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.akka ^
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=akka-javasdk-archetype ^
  -DarchetypeVersion={akka-javasdk-version}
----
--

. Fill in
* groupId: `com.example`
* artifactId: `shoppingcart`
* version: `1.0-SNAPSHOT`
* package: `shoppingcart`

. Navigate to the new project directory.

. Open it in your preferred IDE / Editor.

== Implementing first component

Akka has different kinds of components that you can use to implement your application.
The list of components are:

* xref:java:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entities]
* xref:java:key-value-entities.adoc[Key Value Entities]
* xref:java:http-endpoints.adoc[HTTP Endpoints]
* xref:java:views.adoc[Views]
* xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflows]
* xref:java:timed-actions.adoc[Timers]
* xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consumers]

For this *Getting started* walk-through, we will implement a Shopping Cart based on an Event Sourced Entity.

Through our "Shopping Cart" Event Sourced Entity we expect to manage our cart, adding and removing items as we please. Being event-sourced means it will represent changes to state as a series of domain events. Letâ€™s have a look at what kind of model we expect to store and the events our entity might generate.

=== Define the domain model

First, define the domain class `ShoppingCart` in package `shoppingcart.domain`. 

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java[ShoppingCart.java]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java[tags=top;domain]
----
<1> Our `ShoppingCart` is fairly simple, being composed only by a `cartId` and a list of line items.
<2> A `LineItem` represents a single product and the quantity we intend to buy.

Next, let's define a domain event for adding items to the cart. Add an interface `ShoppingCartEvent` with the `ItemAdded` domain event in package `shoppingcart.domain`:

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCartEvent.java[ShoppingCartEvent.java]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCartEvent.java[tags=top;domain]
----
<1> `ItemAdded` event derives from the `ShoppingCartEvent` interface.
<2> Specifying a logical type name, required for serialization.

Jumping back to the `ShoppingCart` domain class, add business logic to handle the `ItemAdded` domain event for adding items to the cart:

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java[ShoppingCart.java]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java[tag=itemAdded]
----
<1> For an existing item, we will make sure to sum the existing quantity with the incoming one.
<2> Returns an update list of items without the existing item.
<3> Adds the update item to the shopping cart.
<4> Returns a new instance of the shopping cart with the updated line items.

=== Define the entity

Create an Event Sourced Entity named `ShoppingCartEntity` in package `shoppingcart.application`. The class signature should look like this:

[source,java]
.{sample-base-url}/shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/application/ShoppingCartEntity.java[ShoppingCartEntity.java]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/application/ShoppingCartEntity.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Extend `EventSourcedEntity<ShoppingCart, ShoppingCartEvent>`, where `ShoppingCart` is the type of state this entity will store, and `ShoppingCartEvent` is the interface for the events it persists.
<2> Annotate the class so Akka can identify it as an Event Sourced Entity.

Inside `ShoppingCartEntity`, define an `addItem` command handler to generate an `ItemAdded` event, and an event handler to process the event:

[source,java]
.{sample-base-url}/shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/application/ShoppingCartEntity.java[ShoppingCartEntity.java]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/application/ShoppingCartEntity.java[tag=addItem]
----
<1> Validate the quantity of items added is greater than zero.
<2> Create a new `ItemAdded` event representing the change to the state of the cart.
<3> Persist the event by returning an `Effect` with `effects().persist`.
<4> Acknowledge that the event was successfully persisted.
<5> Event handler to process the `ItemAdded` event and return the updated state.

Inside `ShoppingCartEntity`, define a `getCart` command handler to retrieve the state of the shopping cart:

[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/application/ShoppingCartEntity.java[ShoppingCartEntity.java]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/application/ShoppingCartEntity.java[tag=getCart]
----
<1> Store the `entityId` in an internal attribute, to be used elsewhere.
<2> Define the initial state.
<3> Return the current state as a reply to the request.


=== Define the external API

The `Shopping Cart` API is defined by the `ShoppingCartEndpoint`.

Create a class named `ShoppingCartEndpoint` in package `shoppingcart.api`.


[source,java,indent=0]
.{sample-base-url}/shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/api/ShoppingCartEndpoint.java[ShoppingCartEndpoint.java]
----
include::example$shopping-cart-quickstart/src/main/java/shoppingcart/api/ShoppingCartEndpoint.java[tags=top;class;get;addItem]
----

== Run locally

To start your service locally, run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn compile exec:java
----

This command will start your Akka service.

Once successfully started, any defined endpoints should be available at `localhost:9000`.

You can try sending a request using https://curl.se[curl], a minimal command line HTTP client.

Add an item:

[source, command window]
----
curl -i -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9000/carts/123/item -d '
{"productId":"akka-tshirt", "name":"Akka Tshirt", "quantity": 10}'
----

Get cart state:

[source, command window]
----
curl localhost:9000/carts/123
----

== Deploy to akka.io

ifdef::todo[TODO: should it be here, or only in the developent-process page or where?]

Deploy your service following the instructions at xref:concepts:development-process.adoc#_deploy[Development Process - Deploy to Akka].
