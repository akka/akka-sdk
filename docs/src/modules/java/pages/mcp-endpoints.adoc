= Designing MCP Endpoints

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

image:ROOT:endpoint.png[Endpoint,width=100,float=left] An Endpoint is a component that creates an externally accessible API. MCP Endpoints allow you to expose a services to MCP clients such as LLM chat agent desktop applications and agents running on other services.

MCP endpoints in Akka can provide

 * "tools" – functions/logic the MCP client can call on behalf of the LLM
 * "resources" – static resources or dynamic resource templates the MCP client can fetch for the LLM
 * "prompts" - Template prompts created from input parameters

Endpoints are made available using a stateless Streamable HTTP transport defined by link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26[MCP specification 2025-03-26].

== MCP endpoint class ==

To create an MCP endpoint, a class is annotated with `@McpEndpoint` and ACL configuring where it can be accessed from.

The service is available under the path `/mcp` by default, but it is possible to have multiple MCP endpoints in the same
Akka by specifying.

=== Tools

A tool is a public one or zero parameter method made available to MCP clients.

It is important to give a clear description of what the tool does using the description value, since this is how the
calling LLM gains an understanding of what the tool does.

By default, the input schema for the tool is reflectively created based on the input parameter type. The input class may require
additional information per field to help the LLM understand what each parameter means.

Only simple input parameter classes are supported. Fields must be of primitive type, the Java boxed primitive types or strings.

All fields are marked as required in the schema by default, any non-required parameter should have the type `Optional<T>`

----
include::example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/api/ExampleMcpEndpoint.java[tag=tool]
----
<1> An optional tool name. If not defined, the method name is used. Must be unique in the MCP service if defined
<2> A description about what the tool does
<3> The `Description` annotations describing each input for the tool.

For full flexibility and more complex input types, it is also possible to specify the JSON Schema of the input manually in the annotation:

----
include::example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/api/ExampleMcpEndpoint.java[tag=tool-manual-input-schema]
----
<1> The entire JSON Schema string for the input

When using a manual schema it is very important to make sure that the schema is describing a JSON structure that
is actually what is accepted when Jackson parses it into the input parameter type.

=== Resources

A static resource is a public zero-parameter method returning text or bytes. The resource is identified by a unique URI.

----
include::example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/api/ExampleMcpEndpoint.java[tag=static-resource]
----
<1> A URI identifying the specific resource returned by this method
<2> Empty parameter list, a return type that is `String` for raw text content, `byte[]` for byte contents. Other return types are turned into JSON.

A dynamic resource instead defines a URI template with placeholders for sections, the method accepts `String` parameters with the same names.

----
include::example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/api/ExampleMcpEndpoint.java[tag=resource-template]
----
<1> A URI template with placeholders
<2> A parameter list matching the placeholders.

=== Prompts

Prompts are a way to provide example prompts to the MCP client given some input parameters.

----
include::example$doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/api/ExampleMcpEndpoint.java[tag=prompt]
----
<1> Zero or more string parameters to use in the prompts, annotated with `@Description` to describe the purpose of each
<2> Logic to use the input to construct a prompt


== Interacting with other components

The most common use case for endpoints is to interact with other components in a service. This is done through
the `akka.javasdk.client.ComponentClient`. If the constructor of the endpoint class has a parameter of this type,
it will be injected by the SDK.

For more details see xref:component-and-service-calls.adoc[]

== Interacting with HTTP services

It is possible for an MCP endpoint to interact with other services over HTTP. This is done through the `akka.javasdk.http.HttpClientProvider`.

For more details see xref:component-and-service-calls.adoc[]

== Authentication and authorization

The Akka MCP endpoints do not support the OAuth 2.1 flows in the MCP spec.

Endpoint classes can be annotated using the `@ACL` annotations and `@JWT` to control access (individual method annotations are not supported).

It is also possible to access endpoint request headers for custom authorization based on headers.

== Testing MCP endpoints

There is are no specific test kit utilities for MCP, but it is possible to manually construct endpoints and directly call the methods
as well as use the testkit HTTP client together with handcrafted JSON-RPC MCP payloads to exercise MCP tools, prompts and resources.
