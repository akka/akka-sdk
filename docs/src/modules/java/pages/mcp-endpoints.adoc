= Designing MCP Endpoints

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

image:ROOT:endpoint.png[Endpoint,width=100,float=left] An Endpoint is a component that creates an externally accessible API. MCP Endpoints allow you to expose a services to MCP clients such as LLM chat agent desktop applications and agents running on other services.

MCP endpoints in Akka can provide

 * "tools" – functions/logic the MCP client can call on behalf of the LLM
 * "resources" – static resources the MCP can fetch for the LLM

Endpoints are made available using a stateless Streamable HTTP transport defined by link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26[MCP specification 2025-03-26].

== MCP endpoint class ==

To create an MCP endpoint, a class is annotated with `@McpEndpoint` and ACL configuring where it can be accessed from.

The service is available under the path `/mcp` by default, but it is possible to have multiple MCP endpoints in the same
Akka by specifying.

=== Tools

A tool is a public one or zero parameter method made available to MCP clients.

It is important to give a clear description of what the tool does using the description value, since this is how the
calling LLM gains an understanding of what the tool does.

By default, the input schema for the tool is reflectively created based on the input parameter type. The input class may require
additional information per field to help the LLM understand what each parameter means.

Only simple input parameter classes are supported. Fields must be of primitive type, the Java boxed primitive types or strings.

All fields are marked as required in the schema by default, any non-required parameter should have the type `Optional<T>`

<1> Additional field description explaining the purpose of the field to the client
<2> An optional tool name. If not defined, the method name is used. Must be unique in the MCP service if defined.
<3> Optional annotations describing the tool

For full flexibility and more complex input types, it is also possible to specify the JSON Schema of the input manually in the annotation. When doing
this, it is up to you that the schema is describing a JSON structure that can be parsed into the input parameter type
by Jackson:

=== Resources

A resource is a public zero-parameter method returning text or bytes. The resource is identified by a unique URI.

== Interacting with other components

The most common use case for endpoints is to interact with other components in a service. This is done through
the `akka.javasdk.client.ComponentClient`. If the constructor of the endpoint class has a parameter of this type,
it will be injected by the SDK.

For more details see xref:component-and-service-calls.adoc[]

== Interacting with HTTP services

It is also possible to interact with other services over HTTP. This is done through the `akka.javasdk.http.HttpClientProvider`.
