include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Akka is a framework, runtime and memory store for autonomous, adaptive agentic systems. Akka is delivered as a platform that can execute on any infrastructure, anywhere.

image:concepts:akka-agentic-platform.png[Akka Agentic Platform]

Developers create services built with Akka components that - when deployed - become agentic systems. Services can be tested locally or within a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practice using a Testkit that is available with each Akka component. Your services are compiled into a binary that includes the Akka Runtime which enables your services to self-cluster for scale and resilience. Akka clusters are able to execute on any infrastructure whether bare metal, Kubernetes, Docker or edge. You can optionally deploy your services into an Akka-managed cloud environment which automates most Day 2 concerns. We support Serverless, Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC), and Self-Hosted cloud-hosted environments.

|Product |Where To Start

|Akka Orchestration
|Akka provides a durable execution engine which automatically captures state at every step, and in the event of failure, can pick up exactly where they left off. No lost progress, no orphaned processes, and no manual recovery required.

You implement orchestration by creating an Akka service with the `Workflow` component.

|Akka Agents
|Akka provides a development framework and runtime for agents. Agents can be stateful (durable memory included) or stateless. Agents can be invoked by other Akka components or run autonomously. Agents can transact with embedded tools, MCP servers, or any 3rd party data source with 100s of Akka connectors.

You implement an agent by creating an Akka service with the `Agent` component.

You implement an embedded tool within the `Agent` component.

You implement an MCP server with the `MCPEndpoint` component.

You implement APIs that can front an agent with the `HttpEndpoint` and `gRPCEndpoint` components.

|Akka Memory
|Akka provides an in-memory, durable store for stateful data. Stateful data can be scoped to a single agent, or made available system-wide. Stateful data is persisted in an embedded event store that tracks incremental state changes, which enables recovery of system state to its last known modification. State is automatically sharded and rebalanced across Akka nodes running in a cluster to support elastic scaling to terabytes of memory. State can also be replicated across regions for fail over and disaster recovery.

You inherit agentic and episodic (short-term memory) state automatically within the `Agent` component.

You implement long-term and external memory with the `Event Sourced Entities` and `Key Value Entities` components.

You implement propagations of cross-system state with the `View` component. Views implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern.

|Akka Streaming
|Akka provides a continuous stream processing engine which can synthesize, aggregate, and analyze windows of data without receiving a terminating event. Data streams can be sourced from other Akka services or a 3rd party messaging broker or coming in through an Akka Endpoint. Your services can either store intermediate processing results into _Akka Memory_ or trigger commands to other Akka components that take action on the data.

You produce events to a message broker with the `Producer` annotation.

You create a continuous incoming stream of events with the `HttpEndpoint` or the `gRPCEndpoint` components.

You create a stream processor to analyze and act against a stream of data with the `Consumer` component.
|===

The services you build with Akka components are composable, which can be combined to design agentic, transactional, analytics, edge, and digital twin systems. You can create services with one component or many. Let Akka unlock your distributed systems artistry!

== Design goals of Akka

[horizontal]
Simple:: Development is approachable by anyone with coding skills.
Elastic:: Scales processing and memory management gracefully.
Resilient:: Recovers from any form of failure, including network and hallucination.
Interoperable:: Operates with any external system, protocol, or API.
Composable:: Enables system designs to evolve from simple to complex.
Batteries-included:: Includes orchestration, runtimes, and distributed state management.
Production-ready:: No code changes required to move from development to production.

== Anatomy of an autonomous agentic AI system

An autonomous agentic AI system consists of the following behaviors:

[horizontal]
Agents:: Active components that pursue goals by observing input, making decisions, and taking action. May be stateful or stateless. Often orchestrate workflows, interact with memory, or invoke tools.
Tools:: External systems, APIs, or functions that agents can call to perform tasks beyond their own capabilities, such as querying a database or triggering an external service.
Goals:: Define the desired outcome or intent of an agent. Goals guide reasoning and determine what success looks like for a given task or interaction.
Guardians:: Enforce constraints or boundaries on behavior. Guardians ensure the agent stays within acceptable, ethical, or operational limits, even as it explores solutions autonomously.
Adaptation:: Enables the agent to adjust its strategy in response to changing inputs, failure states, or unexpected outcomes. A hallmark of resilient systems.
Coordination:: Allows agents to interact with other agents, users, tools, or services in a coherent way. Coordination is essential for sequencing actions, sharing context, or achieving group-level outcomes.
Shared State (memory):: Provides continuity across invocations, sessions, or agents. Shared state allows the system to retain knowledge, track decisions, and synchronize behavior in distributed environments.

== Autonomous AI runtimes

Akka supports three fundamental runtime types:

1. Durable execution
* Long-lived
* Persists the call stack after every invocation
* Enables recovery and retry mechanisms

2. Transactional
* Short-lived
* High-throughput, concurrent processing

3. Streaming
* Never-ending
* Continuous execution of data streams

Akka combines all three runtime types into a single engine. This allows for high resource utilization (up to 95%) without impacting performance.

== Akka components

Akka provides composable building blocks suitable for constructing agentic AI or distributed systems:

[horizontal]
Agents:: Stateful or stateless processing units
Workflows:: Durable execution with control flow support
Endpoints:: Interfaces for API communication
Entities:: Durable memory stores
Views:: Read-optimized projections
Consumers:: Streaming data processors
Timers:: Time-based triggers

== Component interoperability

Akka components can communicate seamlessly, regardless of physical location. Location transparency ensures efficient message routing and runtime efficiency, even across network boundaries.

There are two main modes of inter-component communication in Akka:

1. **ComponentClient**: Asynchronous, non-blocking invocations. Components return immediately after dispatching a message, regardless of destination.

2. **Events**: Components emit events that others may subscribe to. This pattern enables decoupled, brokerless messaging similar to pub/sub systems. Akka components may also subscribe to events from external sources (e.g., APIs, brokers).

== Component composability

Components can be connected in flexible arrangements, offering creative freedom in system design.

Examples of component connections include:
[horizontal]
Endpoint → Agent:: An API endpoint that invokes an agent for processing.
Endpoint → Workflow:: An API endpoint that triggers a workflow for complex tasks.
Workflow → Agent:: A workflow that orchestrates an agent to perform specific actions.
Agent → Agent:: An agent that delegates tasks to another agent.
Agent → Entity:: An agent that interacts with an entity to store or retrieve data.
Agent → View:: An agent that updates a view with processed data.
Stream → Consumer:: A data stream that is processed by a consumer component.

The possibilities are only limited by the developer's imagination. Akka's composable design encourages experimentation and evolution in system architecture.

== Shared and distributed state (memory)

Akka fulfills all shared data (memory) requirements for agentic AI systems.

[cols="1,1,3", width=85%]
|===
| Type | Provided by | Description
| Agentic | Akka Agent component (automatic for every agent) | Tracks the intermediate steps within a single agent loop. For instance, if an agent invokes three tools before producing a result, agentic memory captures each interaction in that chain. Useful for auditability, tool orchestration and introspection. This is managed automatically by Akka and requires no manual instrumentation.
| Episodic | Akka Agent component (automatic for every agent) | Often called short-term or session memory. Captures conversational history between a single user and an agent during a session. Automatically tracked if an agent is marked as stateful.
| Long-term | Akka Entity component | Represents memory accumulated over many sessions with the same user and agent. Often stored in summarized or aggregated form.
| External | Akka Entity component | Shared memory across agents, users, or systems. This state is durable. Useful for collaborative systems or shared business context.
|===

Akka handles all state as event sourced. Events are recorded sequentially and durably, forming a transparent log of changes. This enables persistence, import/export, replication, and replay without requiring extra work from the developer.

The runtime scales memory across millions of nodes and regions. Failover is supported with replication and low recovery times, typically under 200ms.

== Service clustering

Akka supports horizontal scaling across clustered services. Multiple instances can be launched as needed. Operational tasks are automated by Akka Platform, or may be performed manually in a self-managed environment if desired.
