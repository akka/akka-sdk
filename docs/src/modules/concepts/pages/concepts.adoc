== Anatomy of an Agentic system

An agentic system is a distributed system that requires a variety of behaviors and infrastructure.

image:concepts:agentic-ai-system-anatomy.png[Akka Agentic Platform]

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
[.compact]
|===
|Aspect |AI Role and Responsibility

|Agents
|Components that integrate with AI to perceive their environment, make decisions and take actions toward a specific goal

You implement agents in Akka with the xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component.

|Tools
|Functionality, local or remote, that agents may call upon to perform tasks beyond their core logic.

You invoke tools in Akka through _embedded agent function calls_ or by _invoking a remote MCP tool_. You can implement MCP servers with the xref:java:mcp-endpoints.adoc[MCP Endpoints] component.

|Endpoints
|Externally accessible entry points through which agents are launched and controlled.

You implement Endpoints in Akka using either xref:java:http-endpoints.adoc[HTTP], xref:java:grpc-endpoints.adoc[gRPC] or xref:java:mcp-endpoints.adoc[MCP] Endpoint components.

|Goals
|Clear objectives or outcomes that agents continuously work toward by making decisions and taking actions on their own.

You implement goals in Akka by implementing a multi-agent system _with a planner agent_ using a xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflow] component to orchestrate the cross-agent interactions.

|Guardians
|Components that monitor, protect and evaluate the system against its goals and constraints.

You will soon be able to implements guardians in Akka with an xref:java:agents.adoc#_evaluating_ai_model_quality[Agent evaluation workbench].
|Adaptation
|Continuous, real-time streams from users or the environment which can alter the context, memory or semantic knowledge used by an agentic system.

You implement adaptation in Akka by processing a stream of data from external sensors, either with the xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consumer] component or through streaming HTTP or gRPC interfaces. xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consumers] can modify an agent’s goals, memory, or guardians to affect the behavior of the system.

|Orchestration
|The ability to execute, persist and recover long-running tasks made possible through _durable execution_.

You implement orchestration in Akka with the xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflow] component.

|Memory
|Data that enables agents to reason over time, track context, make correct decisions and learn from experience.

You inherit agentic and episodic (short-term) durable memory automatically when you implement a stateful xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component. You can get long-term, multi-agent memory by implementing xref:java:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entity] or xref:java:key-value-entities.adoc[Key Value Entity] components.

|Registry
|A built-in directory that stores information about all agents so they can be discovered and called upon in multi-agent systems.

You use the registry provided by Akka by xref:java:agents.adoc#_creating_dynamic_plans[annotating each agent], which allows Akka to automatically register and use them as needed.

== Properties of a distributed system

A distributed system is any system that distributes logic or state. Distributed systems embody certain principles that when combined together create a system that achieves responsiveness. Distributed systems are capable of operating in any location: locally on your development machine, in the cloud, at the edge, embedded within a device, or a blend of all.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
[.compact]
|===
| Property     | Definition
| Elasticity
| The system can automatically adjust its resources, scaling up or down to efficiently handle changes in workload.
| Resilience
| The system continues to function and recover quickly, even when parts of it fail, ensuring ongoing availability.
| Agility
| The system can easily adapt to new requirements or changes in its environment with minimal effort.
| Responsiveness
| Most importantly, the system consistently responds to users and events in a timely manner, maintaining a reliable experience.
|===

== Akka components

Akka provides a basket of interoperable components that can be used to design and implement any potential autonomous agentic AI (or distributed) system.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
[.compact]
|===
|Component |Description

|Agents
|Performs one focused AI task using a selected model and prompt. Can hold context with session memory (stateful) or run stateless with no retained history.

|Workflows
|Durable execution with support for sequential, parallel, looping, retry, and failure logic.

|HTTP Endpoints
|Exposes APIs over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Processes input, triggers components, shapes responses, and returns results.

|gRPC Endpoints
|Exposes APIs over gRPC Remote Procedure Calls (gRPC). Uses Protobuf contracts to ensure compatibility. Handles input, triggers logic, and returns results.

|MCP Endpoints
|Exposes tools, resources, and prompts over Model Context Protocol (MCP) protocol. Enables agents to invoke logic, retrieve data, and establish context.

|Entities (memory)
|Long term durable memory accessible by multiple agents, users, APIs, or 3rd party systems.

|Views
|Indexes and queries entity data across IDs or attributes. Built from entity state or events. Enables efficient lookups, filtering, and real-time updates.

|Consumers (streaming)
|Subscribes to and processes event streams or messages from entities, workflows, or external systems.

|Timers
|Schedules future calls with at-least-once delivery. Useful for deferred actions, retries, and timeouts.
|===

== Component interoperability

Systems often rely on distributed components that need to work together. In Akka, components such as Agents, Workflows and Entities interact in ways that support flexibility, scale, and resilience. The aim is to help you build systems that are easy to reason about and maintain, even when deployed across different environments.

In Akka, component relationships are defined in code. At runtime, the platform handles the details. Messages are routed automatically, without requiring you to manage network paths or address resolution. This is known as _location transparency_. It means components can communicate without knowing where the other components are running.

Akka supports two primary ways for components to interact, either with each other or with the outside world.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
[.compact]
|===
|Client Type |Description

|xref:java:component-and-service-calls.adoc[ComponentClient]
|One component can invoke another using a direct call. The Akka runtime handles this communication in a non-blocking way using lightweight virtual threads. Although a call may wait for a reply before continuing, the code remains simple and synchronous. There is no need to use futures, callbacks or other asynchronous programming techniques.

A common example is a Workflow that invokes an Agent to perform a specific task, then waits for the Agent to finish. The syntax is simple and resembles a regular method call.

|Events
|Components can emit events to signal that something has occurred. Other components may subscribe to these events. This model resembles traditional publish-subscribe systems but does not require external brokers.

For example, when an Entity updates its state, it will emit an event. A View can subscribe to that event to stay in sync. Events can also come from external sources, such as APIs or streaming services.
|===

Akka encourages building systems with loosely coupled components. Communication between them is handled in a way that avoids contention and keeps the system responsive, even under heavy load. Blocking operations are managed in a controlled and efficient way, allowing developers to focus on business logic without worrying about low-level concurrency concerns.

This approach supports systems that need to handle large volumes of traffic. Some production environments have processed up to 10 million transactions per second.

The examples below show common patterns for how components interact in an Akka system.

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
[.compact]
|===
| Example Interoperability | Description

| Endpoint → Workflow → Agent +
  Endpoint → Entity → View
| An HTTP request starts a Workflow to process a file. The Workflow invokes an Agent that will later use the file’s content to answer questions. Another Endpoint records user interaction history into an Entity. A View reads from that Entity to reconstruct the conversation.

| Endpoint → Agent → Entity → View +
  Endpoint → Workflow → Entity
| A user sends a query to an Endpoint. An Agent handles the query and stores the result in an Entity. A View builds the conversation history from that data. Separately, another Endpoint starts a Workflow, which also stores its results in an Entity.

| Stream → Consumer → Entity +
  Agent → Endpoint → Entity
| A stream of data is processed by a Consumer, which writes to an Entity for long-term use. At the same time, an Agent invokes logic through an Endpoint and stores the result in an Entity.
|===

Akka provides a way to connect components that is simple to use and reliable in production. By relying on message passing, virtual threads, and transparent routing, the platform helps you focus on what the system should do, rather than how its parts should reach each other.

== Agentic runtimes

Autonomous AI systems require three types of runtimes:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
[.compact]
|===
|Runtime |Description
|Durable Execution
|Long-lived, where the call-stack is persisted after every invocation to enable recovery and retries.

This is utilized when you implement the xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflow] component.

|Transactional
|Short-lived, high volume, concurrent execution.

This is utilized when you implement xref:concepts:grpc-vs-http-endpoints.adoc[Endpoint], xref:java:views.adoc[View], xref:concepts:state-model.adoc[Entity] and xref:java:timed-actions.adoc[Timer] components.
|Streaming
|Continuous, never-ending processes that handle streams of data.

This is utilized when you implement the xref:java:consuming-producing.adoc[Consumer] component or xref:concepts:grpc-vs-http-endpoints.adoc[SSE / gRPC streaming extension of an endpoint].
|===

Akka provides support for all three runtimes within the same SDK. The runtime behavior is automatic within your service based upon the components that you use during development. All of these runtimes leverage an actor-based core, which is a concurrency model with strong isolation and asynchronous message passing between actors. When running a service that executes multiple runtimes, Akka maximizes efficiency of the underlying compute by executing actors for different runtimes concurrently, enabling node resource utilization up to 95%.

== Shared, distributed state (memory)

There are a variety of shared data (memory) use cases within an agentic system.

[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
[.compact]
|===
|Use Case |Provided by |Description
|Short-term
|xref:java:agents.adoc[Agent] component
|Also called “episodic” and “traced” memory, this memory is an auditable record of each input and output that occurs between an agent and its client throughout a single “user” session. Agent clients may or may not be human.

Akka also captures the input and output of every interaction between an agent and an LLM in a single enrichment loop, sometimes called “traced” memory. A single invocation of an agent from a client may cause that agent to invoke an LLM, function tools, or MCP tools many times. Akka’s short-term memory captures all of these interactions in an event log.

Short-term memory is also automatically included when you create xref:java:agents.adoc[an agent]. Short-term memory can be compressed, optimized, replicated, and audited.

|Long-term
|xref:java:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Entity] component
|Also called “shared” and “external” memory, this memory is an auditable record of state that is available to multiple agents, sessions, users, or Akka components.

Use long-term memory to capture the history (often summarized or aggregated) of interactions for a single user across many sessions.

Shared state is represented through an xref:java:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Entity] component. Entities are event-sourced, making all of their changes published through an event stream and accessible by xref:java:agents.adoc[Agents], xref:concepts:grpc-vs-http-endpoints.adoc[Endpoints], xref:java:workflows.adoc[Workflows] or xref:java:views.adoc[Views].
|===

Akka treats all stateful memory as event-sourced objects. Event sourcing is a technique to capture sequential state changes. Akka’s persistence engine transparently persists each event into a durable store. Since all state is represented as an event, Akka’s event engine enables transparent import, export, broadcast, subscription, replication, and replay of events. These behaviors enable Akka to offer a resilience guarantee and multi-region replication, which enables real-time failover with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of <200ms.

All events are stored in an event journal which can be inspected, analyzed, and replayed where appropriate.

Akka’s runtime enables scaling memory across large numbers of nodes that can handle terabytes of data. At runtime, you create 1..n instances of your stateful services. The Akka runtime ensures that there is only a single copy of your data within any particular instance. Your service’s data is sharded across the various instances based upon the amount of RAM space available. Data that cannot fit within RAM is durably available on disk, and can be activated to memory when needed. The Akka runtime automatically routes requests for data to the node that has the data instance requested. For example, if a user “John” were interacting with an agent, “John’s” conversational history would have a unique identifier and exist within one of the instances that is executing the agent service.

As an operator adds or removes physical nodes to the Akka runtime cluster, Akka will automatically rebalance all the stateful data to take advantage of the additional RAM. The clients or users that are interacting with the agent do not need to be aware of the rebalancing as Akka automatically routes each request to the instance with the correct data.

== Service packaging

The services you build with Akka components are composable, which can be combined to design agentic, transactional, analytics, edge, and digital twin systems. You can create services with one component or many.

Your services are packed into a single binary. You create instances of Akka that you can operate on any infrastructure: Platform as a Service (PaaS), Kubernetes, Docker Compose, virtual machines (VMs), bare metal, or edge.

Akka services self-cluster without you needing to install a service mesh. Akka clustering provides elasticity and resilience to your agentic services. In addition to data sharding, data rebalancing, and traffic routing, Akka clustering has built-in support for addressing split brain networking disruptions.

Optionally, you can deploy your agentic services into Akka Automated Operations, which provides a global control plane, multi-tenancy, multi-region operations (for compliance data pinning, failover, and disaster recovery), auto-elasticity based upon traffic load, and persistence management (memory auto-scaling).
