== Design goals of Akka

[horizontal]
Simple:: Development is approachable by anyone with coding skills.
Elastic:: Scales processing and memory management gracefully.
Resilient:: Recovers from any form of failure, including network and hallucination.
Interoperable:: Operates with any external system, protocol, or API.
Composable:: Enables system designs to evolve from simple to complex.
Batteries-included:: Includes orchestration, runtimes, and distributed state management.
Production-ready:: No code changes required to move from development to production.

== Anatomy of an autonomous agentic AI system

An autonomous agentic AI system consists of the following behaviors:

[horizontal]
Agents:: Active components that pursue goals by observing input, making decisions, and taking action. May be stateful or stateless. Often orchestrate workflows, interact with memory, or invoke tools.
Tools:: External systems, APIs, or functions that agents can call to perform tasks beyond their own capabilities, such as querying a database or triggering an external service.
Goals:: Define the desired outcome or intent of an agent. Goals guide reasoning and determine what success looks like for a given task or interaction.
Guardians:: Enforce constraints or boundaries on behavior. Guardians ensure the agent stays within acceptable, ethical, or operational limits, even as it explores solutions autonomously.
Adaptation:: Enables the agent to adjust its strategy in response to changing inputs, failure states, or unexpected outcomes. A hallmark of resilient systems.
Coordination:: Allows agents to interact with other agents, users, tools, or services in a coherent way. Coordination is essential for sequencing actions, sharing context, or achieving group-level outcomes.
Shared State (memory):: Provides continuity across invocations, sessions, or agents. Shared state allows the system to retain knowledge, track decisions, and synchronize behavior in distributed environments.

== Autonomous AI runtimes

Akka supports three fundamental runtime types:

1. Durable execution
* Long-lived
* Persists the call stack after every invocation
* Enables recovery and retry mechanisms

2. Transactional
* Short-lived
* High-throughput, concurrent processing

3. Streaming
* Never-ending
* Continuous execution of data streams

Akka combines all three runtime types into a single engine. This allows for high resource utilization (up to 95%) without impacting performance.

== Akka components

Akka provides composable building blocks suitable for constructing agentic AI or distributed systems:

[horizontal]
Agents:: Stateful or stateless processing units
Workflows:: Durable execution with control flow support
Endpoints:: Interfaces for API communication
Entities:: Durable memory stores
Views:: Read-optimized projections
Consumers:: Streaming data processors
Timers:: Time-based triggers

== Component interoperability

Akka components can communicate seamlessly, regardless of physical location. Location transparency ensures efficient message routing and runtime efficiency, even across network boundaries.

There are two main modes of inter-component communication in Akka:

1. **ComponentClient**: Asynchronous, non-blocking invocations. Components return immediately after dispatching a message, regardless of destination.

2. **Events**: Components emit events that others may subscribe to. This pattern enables decoupled, brokerless messaging similar to pub/sub systems. Akka components may also subscribe to events from external sources (e.g., APIs, brokers).

== Component composability

Components can be connected in flexible arrangements, offering creative freedom in system design.

Examples of component connections include:
[horizontal]
Endpoint → Agent:: An API endpoint that invokes an agent for processing.
Endpoint → Workflow:: An API endpoint that triggers a workflow for complex tasks.
Workflow → Agent:: A workflow that orchestrates an agent to perform specific actions.
Agent → Agent:: An agent that delegates tasks to another agent.
Agent → Entity:: An agent that interacts with an entity to store or retrieve data.
Agent → View:: An agent that updates a view with processed data.
Stream → Consumer:: A data stream that is processed by a consumer component.

The possibilities are only limited by the developer's imagination. Akka's composable design encourages experimentation and evolution in system architecture.

== Shared and distributed state (memory)

Akka fulfills all shared data (memory) requirements for agentic AI systems.

[cols="1,1,3", width=85%]
|===
| Type | Provided by | Description
| Agentic | Akka Agent component (automatic for every agent) | Tracks the intermediate steps within a single agent loop. For instance, if an agent invokes three tools before producing a result, agentic memory captures each interaction in that chain. Useful for auditability, tool orchestration and introspection. This is managed automatically by Akka and requires no manual instrumentation.
| Episodic | Akka Agent component (automatic for every agent) | Often called short-term or session memory. Captures conversational history between a single user and an agent during a session. Automatically tracked if an agent is marked as stateful.
| Long-term | Akka Entity component | Represents memory accumulated over many sessions with the same user and agent. Often stored in summarized or aggregated form.
| External | Akka Entity component | Shared memory across agents, users, or systems. This state is durable. Useful for collaborative systems or shared business context.
|===

Akka handles all state as event sourced. Events are recorded sequentially and durably, forming a transparent log of changes. This enables persistence, import/export, replication, and replay without requiring extra work from the developer.

The runtime scales memory across millions of nodes and regions. Failover is supported with replication and low recovery times, typically under 200ms.

== Service clustering

Akka supports horizontal scaling across clustered services. Multiple instances can be launched as needed. Operational tasks are automated by Akka Platform, or may be performed manually in a self-managed environment if desired.
