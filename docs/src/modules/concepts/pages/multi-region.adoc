= Multi-region operations

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Akka applications run in multiple regions with their data transparently and continuously replicated even across multiple cloud providers.
Akka applications do not require code modifications to run within multiple regions. Operators define controls to determine which regions
an application will operate within and whether that application's data is pinned to one region or replicated across many.

Akka ensures regardless of which region receives a request, the request can be serviced. Multiple replication strategies can be configured, with each offering varying features for different use cases.

Multi-region operations are ideal for:

* Applications that require 99.9999% availability
* Geographic failover
* Geo-homing of data for low latency access
* Low latency global reads
* Low latency global writes

== Examples

The two main replication strategies that Akka offers are replicated reads, and replicated writes.

=== Replicated reads

With replicated reads, an entity has its "home" in one primary region, while being replicated to multiple other regions.

In the example above, the entity representing Alice has its primary region in Los Angeles (USA). When a user in the primary region performs a read request, the request is handled locally, and the response sent straight back.

When the user in the primary region performs a write request, that request is also handled locally, and a response sent directly back. After that write request completes, that write is replicated to other regions, such as in London (UK). A user in London, when they perform a read, that read operation will happen locally, and a response sent immediately back.

A user can also perform write operations on entities in non-primary regions.

In this scenario, a user in London (UK) is performing a write operation on the Alice entity. Since London is not the primary region for the Alice entity, Akka will automatically forward that request to the primary region, in this case, Los Angeles (USA). That request will be handled in the USA, and a response sent directly back to the user.

Akka has a configurable primary selection mode. The two main modes are static, and dynamic. In the static primary selection mode, the primary region for an entity is selected statically as part of the deployment, so all entities have the same primary region. This is useful for scenarios where you want one primary region, with the ability to failover to another region in the case of a regional outage.

In the dynamic primary selection mode, each entity can have a different region that is considered its primary region. This is selected based on whichever region the entity was first written in. This is useful for scenarios where you want to have the primary region for you data close to the users who use the data. A user, Alice, in the USA, will have her data in the USA, while a user Bob, in the UK, will have his data, in the UK.

When Bob makes a request in the UK on his data, that request is handled locally, and replicated to the US, while Alice's requests in the USA with her data are handled locally in the USA, and replicated to the UK.

The data however is still available in all regions. If Bob travels to the USA, he can still access his data.

When Bob travels to the USA, read requests that Bob makes on his data are handled locally, while write requests are forwarded to the UK. Meanwhile, write requests made by Alice on her data is all handled locally, with writes being replicated to the UK.

=== Replicated writes

The replicated write replication strategy allows every region to be capable of handling writes for all entities. This is done through the use of CRDTs, which can be modified concurrently in different regions, and their changes safely merged without conflict.
